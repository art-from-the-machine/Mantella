> Bring Skyrim NPCs to life with AI

Mantella is a Skyrim mod which allows you to naturally speak to NPCs using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (speech-to-text), LLMs (text generation), and [xVASynth](https://github.com/DanRuta/xVA-Synth) (text-to-speech).

# Installation
## Requirements
### Hardware Requirements
There are no discovered minimum requirements at the time of writing for Mantella, but there has been a report of Mantella crashing when running a modlist of 2000 mods. Mantella needs a certain amount of hardware allocation to run successfully, and if this is being soaked up by other hardware intensive mods, it may crash.

The minimum requirements for xVASynth can be found on its [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1765720/xVASynth/). It runs in CPU mode by default, using a single CPU core/thread. Only supports GPU acceleration on NVIDIA cards that have CUDA. Using the same GPU as the game will produce stutter, especially if it can't allocate ~2 GB of VRAM. You may try using an older NVIDIA card that has CUDA on another free PCI-Express slot of your PC and run any CUDA enabled services on that.

### Storage Requirements
This mod requires ~27GB of space when xVASynth and all voice models are installed. Temporarily another ~17GB is needed to unpack the voice models, unless the torrent is used which does not have the voice files archived.


### Compatability
- Some users have reported that Skyrim crashes when Mantella is used with Fuz Ro D'oh. A possible fix is to disable and re-enable Fuz Ro D'oh
- The mod VR Keyboard conflicts with Mantella
- Mantella requires Windows 10 / 11 (it is yet unconfirmed whether it works on Windows 7)
- Mantella has been confirmed to work with the FUS (by pointing skyrim_folder to Skyrim), Librum (by pointing skyrim_folder to overwrite/root), and Wildlands (by pointing skyrim_folder to Wildlander/SKSE) , and Nolvus Wabbajack modlists.
- Mantella needs to be loaded after the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP) mod in your load order
- GPU acceleration is only possible with CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs

### Skyrim
As Mantella accesses and writes to files within your Skyrim folder, it is unlikely to work correctly if you have Skyrim stored in Program Files. Please ensure that you have Skyrim stored outside of this folder (Such as C:\Games\Steam for example).

If you use the Steam version of Skyrim, then note that Steam does not allow to move the old or create a new Steam Game Library on the same disk partition by simply ignoring the attempt to do so. You either move the whole Steam client outside [as described on this Steam Support page](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327) or use [LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) to create a Steam Game Library besides another.

### Mantella Files
The Mantella files can be downloaded from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98631).

#### Mantella Software
Extract this folder somewhere convenient to you (if you need some inspiration, I have it stored in Documents). Do not store this folder in Program Files / (x86) or in your Skyrim folder.

#### Mantella Spell
This file can be installed in the same way as other mods with your mod manager.

## Whisper
guillaumekln's Faster-Whisper version of Whisper is used as Speech-To-Text engine by Mantella. The engine is **already part of the executable** and will download a chosen model automatically when launched. Uses a single CPU core by default when listening to the set default Windows microphone. Alternatively text input can be enabled by setting `microphone_enabled = 0` within _config.ini_ file.

It is reasonably fast even in CPU mode with the base model. _**Optionally**_ to use GPU/CUDA mode, some extra files are required, see [Faster Whisper documentation](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper#gpu). Note that _cuBLAS_ may already be part of the CUDA Toolkit, so you may only require the _`cudnn_###_infer64_8.dll`_ files to be beside the Mantella executable. Afterwards enable `process_device = cuda` under `[Microphone]` within Mantella's _config.ini_.

## xVASynth
xVASynth is used as Text-To-Speech engine by Mantella due to being free open-source software and already having Skyrim voice models trained.
1. Download xVASynth via [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1765720/xVASynth/) or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44184). Do not store xVASynth in your Skyrim folder.

2. Download xVASynth trained voice models of Skyrim for all or any characters that you are likely to encounter. If downloading all models sounds a bit daunting, you can start with the "Male Nord" and "Male Soldier" voice models to at least allow talking to Skyrim guards. You will have to do this manually through the Nexus Mods page or automatically using Nexus Premium, whose API is implemented within xVASynth:

* The voice models can be found under "Optional" (not "Old") from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44184?tab=files) and store the zipped files in a folder. Open xVASynth and drag all zipped voice model files from the folder into the voices panel. Wait for the installation to complete (this may take some time; a popup will display when finished saying "x models installed successfully"). If this method doesn't work for you, you can also unzip the models manually into the correct xVASynth folder (xVASynth\resources\app\models\skyrim). Once the extraction is complete, you can delete the zipped voice model files.

* If you are subscribed to Nexus Premium, open xVASynth and select "Get More Voices" from the bottom left corner. Unselect all games except for Skyrim and download all models. Note that this may require restarting a few times for the downloads to properly complete.

* Another option is to use BitTorrent, the communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing. Peer availability may vary depending on the time of day. Unlike on Nexus Mods, these voice models are already unarchived. So, you only need to point the torrent download location to **models** +***\skyrim*** folder depending on whenever your BitTorrent client makes another subfolder. Having the torrent in the already correct folder for xVASynth means you can become a seeder of it for others without it really impacting your PC or internet performance.

  Open the following URI in your BitTorrent client, note that if you are using the [Brave](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser), it has built-in client:
  
  `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:798BB3190E776BFDCF590910C0805656420F45BC&dn=skyrim&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.opentrackr.org%3a1337&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fexplodie.org%3a6969&tr=wss%3a%2f%2ftracker.btorrent.xyz&tr=wss%3a%2f%2ftracker.openwebtorrent.com`

  Note that this magnet URI may be removed from this page, if any voice model in it also becomes unavailable on Nexus Mods.

3. Download the .lip plugin for xVASynth [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55605) and download FaceFXWrapper from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20061) (you do not need to download CK64Fixes). Instructions on how to install these are on the .lip plugin Nexus page. Make sure to place FaceFXWrapper in the plugins folder as stated on the .lip plugin page.

4. Download the Elder Scrolls pronunciation dictionary from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56778/), and follow the instructions to install.

5. In the xVASynth UI, if "Skyrim" is not already selected, please do so by clicking the arrows symbol in the top left corner. On the navigation bar on the top right of the xVASynth UI, click on the "ae" icon. Once opened, click on the CMUDict dictionary and select "Enable All" in the bottom left corner. Do the same for "xVADict - Elder Scrolls" received from the above step. Once done, close this menu and navigate to the settings menu by selecting the gear icon in the top right corner and ensure that "Audio sample rate (Hz)" is set to 44100. You can also select whether to process voicelines via you CPU or (NVIDIA) GPU from this menu.


## Required Skyrim Mods
Please follow the installation instructions on each of the linked pages:

- [SKSE](http://skse.silverlock.org/) (once installed by following the included readme.txt, run SKSE instead of the Skyrim exe. Note that there is a separate VR version of SKSE)
- [VR Address Library for SKSEVR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58101  )
  or [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)
- [PapyrusUtil SE]( https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048) (the VR version can be found under "Miscellaneous Files")
- [UIExtensions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17561) (if using text input instead of mic)


## Optional Skyrim Mods
These mods aren't strictly necessary for Mantella to work, but they do greatly improve the experience.

- [No NPC Greetings](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/746) (recommended so that Mantella voicelines are not interrupted by vanilla voicelines)
- [UIExtensions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17561) (to use text input instead of mic input)
- [World Encounter Hostility Fix - Performance Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91403  ) (stops certain NPCs from turning hostile when you cast the Mantella spell on them). Note that this mod requires the [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266). Mantella needs to be loaded after USSEP in your load order.


## Language Models (LLMs)
There are a number of different LLMs to choose from, ranging from small local models to expensive externally hosted models. Note that some smaller models may struggle to handle long term conversations and memory summarising. If you just want to get started without thinking too much about it / explore alternative options later and are new to Mantella, you can quickly get started via the OpenAI instructions below (the first month gives you $5 free credits).

### OpenAI (First $5 Free)
Copy your OpenAI secret API key (see [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) if you need help finding it (you will need to set up an account if you haven't already) and paste into `MantellaSoftware/GPT_SECRET_KEY.txt`. Do not share this key with anyone. While there is a free trial, you will need to set up your payment details for the API to work.

### OpenRouter (First $1 Free)
Create an account with OpenRouter. Go to the "Keys" tab and generate a new key, saving its value to MantellaSoftware/GPT_SECRET_KEY.txt. Do not share this secret key with anyone. In MantellaSoftware/config.ini, set `model` to a model from the list [here](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models) (eg `meta-llama/llama-2-70b-chat`). Set `alternative_openai_api_base` to "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" (without quotes).

### text-generation-webui (Free Local Models)
Install text-generation-webui from [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui). Place a local model into the `text-generation-webui\models folder` (to get started, you can download `llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_S.gguf` from [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF/tree/main)). Paste the text "--extensions openai --auto-launch" (as well as "--cpu" for CPU users) into the installed folder's CMD_FLAGS.txt file. Start text-generation-webui and wait for the UI to open in your web browser. Navigate to the "Model" tab, select your model from the drop-down list, and click "Load". In your `MantellaSoftware/config.ini` file, set `alternative_openai_api_base` to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1" (without quotes). Just to note, you need to make sure text-generation-webui is running when running Mantella!

### koboldcpp (Free local models)
Install koboldcpp's latest release from here: https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases.  If you have a nvidia gpu with cuda support, download the koboldcpp.exe file.  If you do not or do not want to use cuda support, download the koboldcpp_nocuda.exe.  Download it outside of your skyrim, xvasynth or mantella folders.  Download a local large language model, such as `llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_S.gguf` from [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF/tree/main)).  Save that somewhere you can easily find it, again outside of skyrim, xvasynth, or mantella.  Run the koboldcpp.exe.  When presented with the launch window, drag the "Context Size" slider to 4096.  Click the "Browse" button next to the "Model:" field and select the model you downloaded.  Under the presets drop down at the top, choose either Use CLBlas, or Use CuBlas (if using Cuda).  You will then see a field for GPU Layers. If you want to use CPU only leave it at 0.  If you want to use your GPU, you can experiement with how many "layers" to offload to your GPU based on your system.  Then click "Launch" in the bottom right corner.  In your `MantellaSoftware/config.ini` file, set `alternative_openai_api_base` to "http://localhost:5001/v1" (without quotes).  Just to note, you need to make sure koboldcpp is running when running Mantella!

### koboldcpp google colab notebook (Free cloud service, potentially spotty access / availablity)
This option does not require a powerful computer to run a large language model, because it runs in the google cloud.  It is free and easy to use, and can handle most .gguf models that are up to 13B parameters with Q4_K_M quantization all on the free T4 GPU you get with google colab.  The downside is Google controls dynamically when the GPUs are available and could throttle your access at any time, so it may not always work / be available.  To use this method, go to this web page: https://colab.research.google.com/github/LostRuins/koboldcpp/blob/concedo/colab.ipynb.  Click the play button that appears below the text "Enter your model below and then click this to start Koboldcpp."  Wait until text stops generating (probably will take a minute or two).  You should see a URL link near the end of the text after a statement like "Connect to the link below," with a silly name, in a format like https://its-taking-time-indeed.trycloudflare.com.  You may want to click on the link just to ensure koboldcpp pops up to ensure its ready before proceeding.  Select that link and copy it with CTRL+C.  In your `MantellaSoftware/config.ini` file, set `alternative_openai_api_base` to that URL by pasting it, and then add /v1 at the end. So it will look something like alternative_openai_api_base = https://its-taking-time-indeed.trycloudflare.com/v1.  Make sure to keep your browser open to the koboldcpp colab notebook while using Mantella so it does not turn off.  If you want to choose a different llm model to use with this method, make sure it is a .gguf model and follow the instructions on the colab to do so.  Be sure to close your browser tab once you're finished your Mantella session, to free up the GPU and help avoid hitting Google's usage limits.

### Other Services
Mantella has the ability to support other language model services, although these services do need to support outputs in the OpenAI format (like text-generation-webui does via the "--extensions openai" option above).


## Setup & Configuration
1. Set up the MantellaSoftware/config.ini file with your paths to Skyrim (`skyrim_folder`), xVASynth (`xvasynth_folder`), and the Mantella Skyrim mod (`mod_folder`). If you are using a Wabbajack modlist, you may need to try searching for a folder called overwrite/root or "Stock Game" in your Mod Organizer 2 / Wabbajack installation path and set this as your `skyrim_folder` path. For FUS users, once you set this path and cast the spell once, you then need to set your `skyrim_folder` path back to your actual Skyrim folder. If you are using Mod Organizer 2, you can find the mod folder by right clicking the mod in the Mod Organizer 2 UI and selecting "Open in Explorer". If you are instead using Vortex, you need to point mod_folder to your Skyrim/Data folder. So Vortex users essentially need to take the Skyrim folder path they have set in `skyrim_folder` and add "\Data" to the end of it.

2. Run Mantella.exe by double-clicking it (ie not by running through Mod Organizer 2 / Vortex as it will not work), wait for the message "Waiting for player to select an NPC..." to display. Once it does, it is ready for you to select an NPC in-game via the Mantella spell.

3. When you first load the mod, MAKE SURE TO CREATE A SAVE AND RELOAD THAT SAVE. The voicelines will not play otherwise! I learned this the hard way. You do not have to create a new game to do this, you can also create a new save in an existing game. While there have not been issues reported with using Mantella in an existing save so far, please be aware that adding mods mid-game can cause problems.

4. The Mantella spell should be added to your inventory under the Illusion category in the Magic menu once you install the mod. Conversations can be started by selecting an NPC with the spell. You can end a conversation by selecting an NPC with the spell again, or by simply saying "goodbye" (preferred). If the NPC responds with "safe travels" then the conversation has ended correctly via this latter method. Note that conversations can only be saved to memory (MantellaSoftware/data/conversations/NPC_Name) by either using the spell or by saying "goodbye". If the NPC is unavailable to the mod, the message "Conversation ended." should immediately pop up in the top left corner and the conversation will exit. If the only message you see from the spell is "Conversation ended", please refer to the "Issues Q&A" section for common solutions to this.

5. Voicelines are cached in the MantellaSoftware/data/voicelines/ folder. If this data takes up too much space over time, the contents of voicelines/ can be periodically deleted.

6. If you are experiencing errors, please see the issues Q&A below. Otherwise, please share the details of the errors and your MantellaSoftware/logging.log file on the Mantella Discord [#issues channel](https://discord.gg/Q4BJAdtGUE). You can also try enabling debugging in `MantellaSoftware/config.ini`. This allows Mantella.exe to run without Skyrim needing to be open. There are a few extra options in the debugging section to play around with which are applied when the debugging option is enabled.


# Issues Q&A
### Conversation ends as soon as spell is cast / [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'path\to\Skyrim Special Edition/some_text_file.txt' 
This is either an issue with the path set for `skyrim_folder` in MantellaSoftware/config.ini, an issue with your Skyrim folder being in Program Files, an issue with the installation of PapyrusUtil, or you are not running Skyrim via SKSE (please see the included readme.txt file in SKSE's downloaded folder for instructions on how to use it). 

Some VR users miss that there is a separate VR version of PapyrusUtil, double check that you have downloaded this version of the mod if you are a VR user (it should be under the Miscallaneous Files section of the Nexus download page). To put it another way, if you have `PapyrusUtil AE SE - Scripting Utility Function` in your modlist, you have the wrong version. 

If you are an SE user, please double check your Skyrim version by right-clicking its exe file in your Skyrim folder and going to Properties -> Details. The "File version" should be listed here. If it is 1.6 or above, you actually have Skyrim AE, not SE (its confusing I know), so please download the AE versions of the required mods. You can tell if PapyrusUtil is working by checking if you have a file called `_mantella__skyrim_folder.txt` in your `skyrim_folder` path.

If you have the required mods installed, then this issue might instead be caused by the `skyrim_folder` being set incorrectly. This only seems to be an issue for Mod Organizer 2 / Wabbajack modlist users. Some Mod Organizer 2 setups move the text files created by the Mantella spell to another folder. Try searching for a folder called overwrite/root or "Stock Game" in your Mod Organizer 2 / Wabbajack installation path to try to find these Mantella text files, specifically a file called `_mantella__skyrim_folder.txt`. If you find this file, then please set its folder as your `skyrim_folder` path.


### ChatGPT API Error: cannot access local variable 'audio_file' where it is not associated with a value
This error occurs when something has failed in a previous step (likely an issue with xVASynth / not having FaceFXWrapper installed). Please check your MantellaSoftware/logging.log file to see the error which occurred before this, which should provide more clarification. If you are still ensure, please share your logging.log file to the Discord's issues channel.

### NPCs keep repeating the same line of dialogue
This is an issue with `mod_folder` not being set to the correct path in MantellaSoftware/config.ini. If you are using Mod Organizer 2, you can find the correct path by right-clicking the Mantella mod in the Mod Organizer 2 UI and selecting "Open in Explorer". If you are using Vortex, you should instead set this `mod_folder` path to your Skyrim/Data folder.

### No message box displayed to say spell has been added / Mantella spell is not in spell inventory
This is an issue with the way the spell mod itself has been installed. Please check your Skyrim version by right-clicking its exe file in your Skyrim folder and going to Properties -> Details. The "File version" should be listed here. If it is 1.6 or above, you have Skyrim AE. If it is below 1.6, you have Skyrim SE. If you are using VR, there are separate versions of the required mods for VR (PapyrusUtil tends to catch out a lot of VR users, the VR version of this file is under "Miscellaneous Files" on the download page). If you are running the mod via the GOG version of Skyrim, there are slight differences in setting up a mod manager as discussed in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJYddISZdeo).

### RuntimeError('PytorchStreamReader failed reading zip archive: failed finding central directory')
If an xVASynth voice model is corrupted, this error will display in MantellaSoftware/logging.log. Please re-download the voice model in this case. You may alternatively need to redownload xVASynth.

A way to check for other corrupted voice models, is to compare the file sizes within /models/skyrim/ folder of xVASynth. If they diverge from the norms, redownload **just** those. The norms for voice model sizes are **~54 MB** and/or **~90 MB** (v2 voice models) & **~220 MB** or **~260 MB** (v3 voice models)

### Loading voice model... xVASynth Error: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))
If this xVASynth Error occurs after the "Loading voice model..." message (as can be seen in your MantellaSoftware/logging.log file), this is likely an issue with a corrupted voice model. Please try redownloading the model from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44184). If you have `use_cleanup` enabled, try setting this value to 0 in MantellaSoftware/config.ini.

If this does not resolve your issue, please share the text found in your xVASynth/server.log file on the [Discord's #issues channel](https://discord.gg/Q4BJAdtGUE) for further support.

### Voicelines are being displayed in Mantella.exe but are not being said in-game
Try creating a save and then reloading that save. This ensures that the Mantella voice files get registered correctly. 

If the above fails, a more unlikely reason for voicelines not playing is if you have updated the Mantella spell with a more recent version by replacing files in the mod's folder. If this is the case, open Skyrim, end all Mantella conversations and unequip the Mantella spell, and create a save. In your mod organizer, disable the Mantella spell plugin. Open your newly created save and create another save (now with no Mantella mod). Finally, in your mod organizer re-enable the Mantella spell plugin. This should effectively "reset" the mod. When you next open your recent save, you should see a notification that the Mantella spell has been added to your inventory.

### 'Starting conversation with' without the NPC name is displayed ingame and nothing happens after
Make sure Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) is started before Skyrim itself.
[SKSE ReadME](https://skse.silverlock.org/skse_readme.txt)

### NPC 'XYZ' could not be found in skyrim_characters.csv
This means that the NPC's name exactly as written in the error message could not be found in skyrim_characters.csv. If you are running Skyrim in another language, sometimes the NPC's name in this language does not match up to the English name, causing this error. It might also mean that the character is missing from skyrim_characters.csv. Please reach out on the Discord's issues channel if this is the case

### NPCs only respond with "I can't find the right words at the moment."
This either means the ChatGPT servers are currently down or the API key has not been set up correctly / is missing payment information. If it is the latter issue, please check MantellaSoftware/logging.log to see the exact error

### Microphone is not picking up sound / exe stuck on "Listening..."
Make sure that your mic is picking up correctly on other software and that it is set as your default. For example, you can go to User Settings -> Voice & Video on Discord to test your mic. Otherwise, try adjusting the `audio_threshold` setting in MantellaSoftware/config.ini (instructions on how to do so are inluded in config.ini). If all else fails, make sure that no other microphones are plugged in except the one you want to use. There may be a rogue microphone such as a webcam picking up as your default!

### 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'
This error means that Whisper is unable to find a connected microphone. Please ensure that you have a working microphone plugged in and enabled.

### "Invalid start byte" error
This error occurs when you introduce character symbols that can't be recognised either in MantellaSoftware/config.ini or skyrim_characters.csv. Please try re-downloading these files. Note that if you are using Excel to edit the CSV, Excel often likes to corrupt CSVs when saving these files. If you are experiencing issues with Excel, there are free CSV editors available such as [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). 

### Mantella.exe closes after "VAD filter removed 00:00.000 of audio" statement
This is an issue related to CUDA. Please try setting `process_device` to "cpu".

### Mantella.exe opens, but does not display any text
Ensure that you are not running Mantella.exe via a Vortex / Mod Organizer 2 shortcut, as this does not start the program properly.

### ERROR: xVASynth Error: [WinError 5] Access is denied
This happens when your antivirus is blocking Mantella.exe from working. Please add Mantella.exe to your safe list or try running as administrator.

### Cannot start new conversation after ending previous conversation (conversation ended message)
You might need to say something in the mic for Mantella.exe to realise that the conversation has ended (while it is on "Listening..." it does not look out for the conversation ending). The exe will check if the conversation has ended after 30 seconds by default. You can change this via the `listen_timeout`` setting in MantellaSoftware/config.ini, but just keep in mind if it is too short this will effect conversations as the exe will occasionally stop listening for mic input to check if the conversation has ended

### RuntimeWarning: Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work
xVASynth related warning when started by Mantella. Thus far has not impacted Mantella so it can be safely ignored.


# Adding Modded NPCs
Mantella allows you to talk to any NPC. If you cast the Mantella spell on an unknown / modded NPC, a message will display in Mantella.exe asking you to restart Skyrim. Once this is done, the NPC will be able to speak to you. 

If a given NPC cannot be found in `MantellaSoftware/data/skyrim_characters.csv`, Mantella will try its best to fill in the blanks on the NPC, making an educated guess on the NPC's background based on their name (eg Whiterun Guard) and on their voice model based on various factors such as race and sex.

Of course, if you are unhappy with Mantella's assumptions, you can add full support for modded NPCs to `MantellaSoftware/data/skyrim_characters.csv` by adding a new row containing the NPC's name (`name`), background description (`bio`), and voice model (`voice_model`). The rest of the column entries can be left blank. If you don't have Excel, you can open this CSV file with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). 

Note that if the modded NPC is custom voiced there may not be a xVASynth model available, and you will need to assign the NPC a vanilla voice. By default, Mantella does not create memories for NPCs missing from `skyrim_characters.csv` as they are assumed to be generic (eg there are many NPCs called "Whiterun Guard" so it does not make sense for them all to share the same memory).

For further support and examples of how other users have added modded NPCs, see the [custom-npcs channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/Q4BJAdtGUE).

/wiki/Eddie_Winter,"Edward L. ""Eddie"" Winter is a pre-War mob boss turned ghoul living in Boston in 2287.
Eddie Winter was a notorious criminal and leader of an Irish crime family operating in Boston before the Great War. The Boston Bugle reported that he owned a sub shop in South Boston. He ordered the assassinations of Ron Trevio and Johnny Montrano, Jr. and participated in several robberies.[1] He was also a business partner with the Flynn Brothers and was involved in operations with their trucking company, Wicked Shipping.[2]
In 2077, the Boston Police Department created a task force code-named ""Operation Winter's End"" to secretly investigate Winter, led by Captain Jonathan Widmark. During this investigation, the extent of Winter's crimes was revealed: he was involved in almost every type of crime that could be committed, ranging from petty larceny to first-degree murder. It was suspected, though not proven, that Winter was behind the murder of the fianc√©e of the lead detective, Ms. Jennifer Lands, in August 2077.[3] Around October of that year, the Boston Police Department closed the case against Winter. This was done due to Winter's deal with the BADTFL to incriminate his associates. His cooperation with the district attorney granted him immunity from prosecution for his crimes.[4]
To ensure he would survive the prospect of nuclear devastation, shortly before the Great War, Eddie Winter willingly became a ghoul through a radiation experiment to obtain eternal life[5]; it's even postulated that this made him one of, if not the first subject of ghoulification in history. He then entered a secure bunker he'd secretly had built and remained there for the next 210 years.
In 2287, his choice of life as a criminal eventually caught up to him when the synth Nick Valentine, guided by the memories of his pre-war counterpart's grudge against the crime boss, figured out the code and broke into his secure vault under Andrew station with the Sole Survivor where he personally ended Winter's second reign of terror before it could begin.[6]",Eddie Winter,MaleRaider01,maleboston,NPCMEddieWinter,Human(pre-War)Ghoul,Male,,1359652,616902,YetAnotherModder,84,000969C6,000969C6,0014BF24,NPCMEddieWinter,NPCMEddieWinter,EddieWinter,EddieWinter,

/wiki/Liberty_Prime,"Liberty Prime or Liberty Prime Mark II is a unique U.S. Army robot.[1]  Liberty Prime was found and brought to working order by the Brotherhood of Steel. Its total restoration was due to the assistance of Dr. Madison Li, who solved Prime's power issues in the year 2277. After its destruction at the satellite relay station in the same year it remained in disrepair until 2287, when it was brought to Boston for restoration and activation. It plays a major role in Fallout 3, Broken Steel, and Fallout.
Prime is the result of military contract 38917, for which the United States Army contracted RobCo Industries and General Atomics International to collaborate on an unprecedented joint project.[2] The goal being to create the most powerful combat robot in the history of warfare, to liberate Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese occupation.[2] Development commenced in 2072, and in the words of General Constantine Chase, initiator of the project, Liberty Prime ""will be the very embodiment of American military might -- a walking, talking, nuke-tossing hero who will remind the world what it means to be a super power.""[2][Non-game 1][2] Confident that the project would soon yield result, General Chase publicly confirmed in June 2072 that the U.S. Army was working with General Atomics and RobCo to create a superweapon meant to establish dominance of the United States on the Alaskan front.[3] Propaganda posters also purported the existence of a Chinese super robot, Warmachine, and called for the United States to build its own.[4]
However, while the chassis, voice module, and weapons systems were all completed by the projected date, the developers were unable to develop a power source compact enough to power all of its systems. Stanley Bloomfeld, project lead, was unable to ascertain a solution and Vault-Tec was unable to help, as the only person capable of solving this conundrum - Stanislaus Braun - went into seclusion shortly before the problems manifested. The robot could technically move and navigate terrain, but it would only do so with all weapons systems offline.[5] The delay was unacceptable and the U.S. military was forced to press on without the aid of Liberty Prime. The Alaskan campaign was won, at a heavy cost in men and materiel, while Liberty Prime remained in a bay below the Pentagon, waiting for a solution to its power management problems.[6]
In 2255, Owyn Lyons and his Brotherhood of Steel expedition arrived in Washington and found Liberty Prime beneath the ruins of the Pentagon. This impressive find led them to claim the Pentagon as the D.C. Bunker, their Citadel, and resuming development of the failed pre-War project.[7] However, the same problems would plague the program as before the war. Chief among these was energy consumption. The Brotherhood had no way of powering the behemoth robot, even with Reginald Rothchild heading the project.[8]
For 20 years, the Brotherhood struggled to launch its robot.[8] Every attempt to gain ground was compensated with failures. As of May 8, 2277, the research team had managed to restore 46% power to internal processors, 45% to weapons, and 37% to power management systems, and attempted to redistribute power to bring the robot online.[9] The attempt proved fruitless, with problems coming from the least expected direction: Liberty Prime himself. Rothchild's team tried to bypass the aggressive combat subroutines by trying to fool the robot with a neural dampener that power was being redistributed from a source other than its weapons. However, the onboard AI routines detected the attempt and again refused to allow the researchers to draw power away from its weapon systems. The attempt fried some of the robots circuitry and set the project back three months.[10]
Another attempt was made on July 13, 2277.[11] This time, a faulty power capacitor caused a power spike and degraded system performance, dropping internal processor, weapons, and power management power to 12%, 13% and, 1% respectively.[11] Tired of struggling with rerouting power, Rothchild ended power management experiments and resumed work on Accelerated Vector Fusion module to simply meet the power demands. Inspired by the work of Dr. Madison Li in Rivet City, Rothchild hoped for a breakthrough.[12] The attempt caused injury to several individuals. In its first major experiment on August 1, 2277, the AVF device resulted in second degree burns for Scribe Bowditch, while an accidental weapon discharge nearly killed Elder Lyons.[13] These events led to stricter control imposed on the experimentation team.[14]
Despite the accidents, Rothchild's team was able to restore much of the power and improve its distribution bringing power to internal processors to 87% and weapons to 60%, but problems with power management (operating at 3% efficiency) made deployment impossible. Mobility and navigation translation remained at 0%. Only the voice module worked at 100% at all times, mocking the researchers.[15]
When the Enclave seized Project Purity, Dr. Madison Li arrived at the Citadel. With her experience in fusion research and applications, Rothchild and his team were able to resolve the power management problems.[16][17]
Liberty Prime was brought online for the first time. Deployed against the Enclave in the battle of Project Purity, Liberty Prime made its way towards Project Purity over the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The massive robot acted as a spearhead, destroying Vertibirds and entrenched Enclave positions.[18]
Lyons's Pride and the Lone Wanderer followed the robot's path of destruction, engaging any Enclave personnel that survived the initial assault. Liberty Prime continued up to the purifier, destroying photonic resonance barriers set up around the island to deny land access. Upon arrival at the Memorial, Liberty Prime and Lyons Pride set up a security perimeter, while Sarah Lyons and the Lone Wanderer headed inside the facility.[18]
The victory at the purifier set the pattern for attacks using Liberty Prime. For two weeks, the Brotherhood mopped up Enclave forces throughout the Capital Wasteland, until the Battle of Rockland. The attack followed a standard pattern. Liberty Prime was deployed as spearhead, destroying the bulk of the enemy forces and bypassing their fortifications, while ground troops under Tristan's command followed the robot, mopping up any stragglers. The initial attack went well and the combat group penetrated enemy defenses right up into the facility. Liberty Prime proceeded to create an access point into the facility, by punching through the concrete walls.[19]
However, this was a ruse by the Enclave. Liberty Prime was lured into the cul-de-sac in front of the Rockland facility in order to be destroyed. Just as it opened the facility to the Brotherhood's assault, the Enclave initiated a tactical missile bombardment from the Bradley-Hercules orbital weapons platform, turning the area into a kill zone. Liberty Prime was destroyed, with Tristan's forces just barely able to reach minimum safe distance.[20][19] The destruction of Liberty Prime put the Brotherhood in a very difficult position, as it removed the only significant military advantage it had over the Enclave.[21]  Lyons had little in the way of men and resources at the beginning of the conflict with the Enclave, and after the loss of Prime all of these problems surfaced, exacerbated by the ongoing water delivery program. With the resources pooled into defense against the Enclave, the Brotherhood had to rely on the Lone Wanderer as their trump card.[22] Meanwhile, Rothchild immediately began work on rebuilding Prime, hoping to restore him to working condition. Eventually, the project was shelved due to a lack of success.
Proctor Ingram was ordered to resume the attempt to fix Prime in 2287. Despite the terrible state of salvage,[23] she labored for several years to reconstruct the robot.[24] When Elder Arthur Maxson realized that the Institute could be tracked down and confronted in the Commonwealth, Prime's components were loaded onto the Prydwen and brought along for the campaign. A special gantry was constructed in the ruins of the Boston Airport, to assemble the war machine under Proctor Ingram's orders - as long as the Brotherhood would be able to salvage the components that would allow for it to be deployed.[25]
There were several problems that had to be rectified. The fragile CPU blew itself out whenever the scribes tried feeding power to it, due to the complexity of the robot's power system.[26] The missile strike that destroyed Prime also wrecked the power system, necessitating the development of a new system, enlisting the aid of either Doctor Madison Li or Professor Scara.[26] They helped restore the total corruption of the memory core, caused by improper salvaging of Prime and flaws in its original design (lack of inertial dampeners and titanium shock casing to protect it).[27][28]
The next step in the reconstruction was rebuilding its limbs. Electromagnetic actuators were used for this purpose, constructed on site using high powered magnets.[25] The restored memory core posed a constant problem, as explaining to a combat robot why it can't move was a drain on the scribes' patience.[29] Following the successful assembly of the limbs, the penultimate component of the combat robot was a supply of modified Mark 28 nuclear bombs, necessary if it was ever to operate at more than half capacity.[30] The nukes salvaged from the Commonwealth at Sentinel site Prescott had to be adapted to remain stable in the unconventional launcher.[31]
The final step in bringing Liberty Prime back to life was reactivating its fusion reactor, which lay dormant ever since its destruction. Kept online by power leeched from the Prydwen, Prime's reactor required the experimental beryllium agitator to cold start the reactor.[32] The agitator - located at the Mass Fusion Building - would provide the power surge necessary to start the reaction.[33]
Liberty Prime has two primary weapons, including a head-mounted liberty laser[34] and a back-mounted supply of Mark 28 nuclear bombs.[35] Prime was able to destroy fortifications by walking through them.[36]
The robot had drawbacks in function, including lacking a sufficient fusion power source.[37] As the war with China dragged on, the project was eventually put on hold. The self-sustaining fusion reactor remained active, powering the robot, until finally Madison Li resolved the power distribution and management problems, allowing it to be deployed into combat.[16] In addition, the machine's slow speed and large size made it vulnerable to high-yield artillery and orbital missile strikes capable of overwhelming its armor.[36]",Liberty Prime,robot_assaultron,maleboston,RobotLibertyPrime,Robot,,,1137488,1259506,YetAnotherModder,84,001337F2,001337F2,00115B50,,RobotLibertyPrime,MQ11LibertyPrimeBoSLibertyPrime,BoSLibertyPrime,

If she is encountered as she leaves Bunker Hill, she will first transit to Vault 81, where her normal circuit then begins. Her transit route is quite complex. She leaves Bunker Hill by the east door like the other caravan merchants. Unlike the others, however, she heads south to the river, west along the north bank of the river to Monsignor Plaza, north through Cambridge to the Collegiate administration building, west to College Square, south back to the river, crosses the river at the wreck of the USS Riptide, passes Diamond City without stopping until reaching Vault 81. An alternative transit route goes south via Cabot Square and around Boston Common to halt outside Diamond City. These transit routes provide ample opportunities for hostile encounters.
If the player character fast travels back from another cell to the location where Cricket is currently halted (including Bunker Hill as well as her circuit stops) or sleeps in or near one of these locations, her departure will be delayed until shortly after they arrive, or wake up.

/wiki/Weathers_(Fallout_4),"Doc Weathers is a traveling doctor and caravaneer operating out of Bunker Hill. His only intentions appear to be monetary gain and assisting the general community, but a further approach into his history reveals him to be an informant on runaway synths for the Institute, one of the most feared organizations in the Commonwealth.[1]
Weathers is accompanied by his loyal pack brahmin, Idiot, and employs two caravan guards for protection. His route passes through local settlements in the northeastern region of the Commonwealth, including County crossing and the Slog.
The Weathers caravan moves through the northeast part of the map according to an apparently random route that varies each trip. Each trip may stop at, or simply pass any or all of the northeastern settlements: County crossing, Finch farm, and the Slog. These settlements may be visited in any order and approached from a variety of directions. If trade caravan posts are built at player controlled settlements in the area, these may also be visited. A final possible halt is an unmarked campsite (with a cooking station and a full bed) to the west of the Museum of Witchcraft. At each of the four halt locations, he will stop for six game hours normally. 
In addition to these possible halts, the caravan may pass close to other locations (without stopping), including Saugus Ironworks, Hub City Auto Wreckers, Lynn Pier Parking, and Longneck Lukowski's Cannery.

/wiki/Edward_Deegan,"Edward Deegan is a ghoul and an associate of the Cabot family in 2287. He has been in the employ of the family since before the Great War.
Working together with Jack Cabot, Edward is a man always looking out to find people who can handle themselves and who can help further his boss' plans. For centuries, Edward has faithfully served as the liaison between his employers, their other staff and outsiders. He is charged with being the bodyguard, messenger, head of security and righthand man for the centuries-old family, who in return, give him room and board in their villa, located in Beacon Hill.
Edward was originally hired by the Cabot family in November 2058, replacing a previous aide, Daniel. Highly recommended, Edward was groomed as a replacement, gradually eased into managing family affairs ever since his induction. The process was greatly helped by Wilhelmina Cabot, as the notoriously untrusting family matriarch took to young Edward fast.[1] By 2077, Edward became an indispensable asset, integral to the well-being of the family.[2]
When the Great War began, Jack and Deegan secured the Parsons State Insane Asylum from looters and hired a security team to protect archaeologist and family patriarch Lorenzo Cabot, the sole resident of the institution, who is kept in a high-security cell located within the basement of the facility. These measures help to prevent him from being freed by anyone who seeks to exploit his otherworldly powers.
Jack found his father's special serum had made him immune to the effects of radiation, yet Edward, not being part of the family, did not have access to the serum. The constant trips between the asylum and the Cabot house caused him to be heavily exposed to radiation and he fell severely ill. By 2080, Edward's radiation sickness led to his permanent ghoulification. While it subjected him to prejudice, it also meant that Cabots would retain access to his essential skills for as long as necessary. Jack treated his employee's radiation poisoning and managed to keep him alive. This greatly extended his life, making him virtually immortal from natural causes of death, similar to the rest of the Cabots. Given that Edward was instrumental in both maintaining the power grid at Parsons and keeping it secure with a mercenary retinue, this was a development as fortuitous as it was lucky.[3]
As of 2287, Edward, on behalf of Jack, is seeking a new gun to work for the family following a series of unusual events that may end up being their undoing if left unchecked, such as Emogene's disappearance and the theft of an important package by a band of raiders, which resulted in the death of their courier, Ben.",Edward Deegan,maleghoul,maleghoul,NPCMEdwardDeegan,Ghoul,Male,,294593,294592,YetAnotherModder,84,00047EC0,00047EC0,00047EC1,NPCMEdwardDeegan,NPCMEdwardDeegan,EdwardDeegan,EdwardDeegan,

She mentions that Bunker Hill once counted on the Minutemen to protect the merchants but, since they fell apart, the people of Bunker Hill had to find a way to get by on their own.[1] Kessler convinced the raider gangs in the area that allowing the merchant settlement to operate was more profitable than the loot from a single raid. Since then they have been forced to pay protection money, in addition to dealing with the demands of the various caravan bosses.[2][3]
Currently, Kessler pays tribute to at least three raider gang leaders in the area. James Wire is paid in caps and causes such little trouble that Kessler has been pressured to lower payment, though she is hesitant to do so after what happened ""last time.""[4] Jared is paid in chems, mainly Jet and Psycho, which Kessler buys relatively cheaply from the dealer AJ.[5] Judge Zeller, however, has been causing problems by accepting the tribute but still hitting the caravans. She plans on hiring someone to take out his ""army.""[6] In addition, Kessler also worries about the raider gang leader Tower Tom, who refuses to accept tribute (going so far as to kill one of the messengers she sent) and has been pushing ever closer to Bunker Hill's trade route.[7]

She also sells shipments of common raw materials, such as asbestos, circuitry, crystal, oil and screws. Carla's sales territory includes the northwest quarter of the region, which usually not many dangers inhabit, removing the need for a hired gun.
Carla takes the protection of her merchandise from potential thieves very seriously and refuses to give in to any robbery attempts. Refusing any service to widely known ne'er-do-wells or outlaws, any attempts to rob her caravan are always in vain.[1]

/wiki/Jack_Cabot,"Jack Cabot is a member of the Cabot family living in the Cabot House in Boston in 2287. 
Born sometime in the 19th century, Jack is the son of archaeologist Lorenzo Cabot. In 1894,[2] his father led an expedition to the Rub' al Khali desert in search of the fabled Ubar civilization.[3][4] After Lorenzo returned to Boston from the Middle East with an alien artifact, he was found to have been granted supernatural abilities, yet also been rendered insane by the effects of the crown.[5] For the safety of both Lorenzo and those around him, Jack, as superintendent, imprisoned the archaeologist along with his artifact at Parsons State Insane Asylum in 1898.[6]
Jack's life is devoted to investigating the artifact. His studies into the mysterious object subsequently resulted in the development of a serum derived from his father's blood that defied aging, halting and even reversing the process. In turn, Jack's special serums granted him and his family the ability to live for more than four hundred years.[4][7] Over that time, he has spent his time researching, protecting his family and their secrets from the outside world, and finding servants to help carry out his work.[8] He maintained his position by occasionally faking his death and ""inheriting"" the family property as a distant relative.[9] In the aftermath of the Great War, he and his newest helper, Edward Deegan, rushed to Parsons to secure his father's containment. This led to Deegan's ghoulification, which benefited Jack due to no longer needing to find replacement helpers. After the situation stabilized, Jack buried himself in his research while Deegan began handling the family's external affairs.[10][11]
More than two centuries after the Great War, he continues to live in Cabot House with his mother Wilhelmina and sister Emogene, furthering his research into a cure for his father's insanity. While he initially disagreed with his father's theory of an extraterrestrial precursor civilization, he has come to believe in it over the years and hopes to one day mount a similar expedition himself. He believes that humanity can recover from the nuclear devastation and regain its former glory.[12][13] His sister, Emogene, has a more negative view of his efforts, seeing him as controlling for trying to curb her trips outside the house and suspecting that he no longer truly cares to cure their father.[14][15]",Jack Cabot,JackCabot,JackCabot,NPCMJackCabot,Human,Male,,294594,294583,YetAnotherModder,95.0,00047EB7,00047EB7,00047EC2,NPCMJackCabot,NPCMJackCabot,,JackCabot,

She is aware that this angers Lorenzo and would have severe consequences for her if he ever escapes his containment.[4][5][6]
Wilhelmina rarely left the Cabot House even before the Great War, and she has remained in the house ever since, attended to by her children and Edward Deegan, whom she particularly likes because of his attentiveness to her.[7] As a result, she is greatly out of touch with the rest of the world, keeping her distinguished attitude and high-class standards despite the poor state of the outside world. She spends her time worrying about various household concerns, to the irritation of both Emogene and Jack.[8][9][10] Emogene sees Wilhelmina as even more of a person out of time than she and Jack are: in denial of how much the world has changed and only being kept alive by her regular doses of serum.[11][12] This has not stopped Emogene from consistently leaving Cabot House, which Jack believes is done specifically to provoke their mother.

/wiki/Danse,"Paladin Danse (unit designation M7-97,[1] registration DN-407P) is the commanding officer of Recon Squad Gladius, a Brotherhood of Steel unit deployed to the Commonwealth in 2287. Should the Sole Survivor join the Brotherhood and advance to the rank of knight, he will offer his services as a companion. He is a major character in the Brotherhood of Steel storyline in¬†Fallout. 
Danse's earliest memories are of growing up an orphan living in the Capital Wasteland. As a child he made a dangerous living by scavenging the D.C. ruins until he could afford to open his own junk stand in Rivet City. It was at that time he befriended a man named Cutler, and together the two scraped by as traders.[2] When the Brotherhood came through the city on a recruiting run, they both felt like it was the best chance for making something out of themselves, so they joined up, staying together as the closest of friends.[3]
Sponsored by Paladin Krieg, Danse was pushed hard from the beginning. Krieg himself was a model of bravery, zeal and loyalty, and saw the spark of greatness in Danse. He was correct to single him out of his squad and push him to excel, as by 2277 Danse reached the rank of paladin and was granted command of his own squad. Danse did not participate in the assault on Adams Air Force Base, unlike his mentor and sponsor. The Brotherhood paid a steep price for the victory over the Enclave, however, and Paladin Krieg was one of the casualties. Danse was not deterred by his death, and continued to rise through the ranks in the Brotherhood, pushing exceptional people entrusted him in the same way as Krieg did him.[4][5]
One of his achievements was earning a post at the newly launched Prydwen, together with Cutler, now a Brotherhood knight. Launched in 2282, the airship granted the Brotherhood the ability to project power virtually anywhere on the Eastern Seaboard.[6][7] A year into the posting, Cutler disappeared while on a routine scouting operation. Paladin Danse convinced his commanding officer to send out a search and rescue squad under Danse's command. Three weeks later, he and his men found Cutler in the middle of a super mutant hive. As it turned out, Cutler's squad was ambushed and wiped out, except for its commander. Danse discovered his friend in the middle of an FEV transformation into a super mutant. Unable to reverse the mutation, Danse did what a paladin was expected to do for a mortally wounded comrade: He delivered a mercy kill.[8]
While Danse continued to serve the Brotherhood, Cutler's death changed something inside. Although he met and led many other soldiers, brave, honest and heroic, none became close friends like Cutler. He kept them at a distance, unwilling to form close bonds and having to suffer the agony of losing a true friend again.[9] It also left him with a lasting, deep loathing of super mutants.[10]
As one of the most trusted and capable field commanders in the Brotherhood, Paladin Danse was a natural choice for Elder Arthur Maxson, as head of recon squad Gladius. Part tech recovery, part search and rescue, Danse and his squad was sent to the Commonwealth in the late 2286 for a tech recovery operation, following in the footsteps of the lost recon squad Artemis. Nobody expected that it would become another turning point in the Brotherhood's history.[11]
The squad crossed the border into the Commonwealth in January 2287, suffering several equipment losses in fighting with raiders, including Knight Keane's power armor.[12] By February, Danse had his men clear Cambridge Police Station, establishing a forward operating base in the Commonwealth.[13] By April, Gladius had a strong enough position to begin recovery and search operations, with Corvega assembly plant near Lexington identified by Scribe Haylen as the first target. Initial recon by Knight-Sergeant Dawes revealed a large raider presence on sight, led by Jared, a minor raider warlord. Danse decided to risk breaching their defenses, which turned out to be a costly mistake: The squad was spotted on approach and came under fire. When Knight Worwick was severely wounded, Danse ordered a general retreat. Knight Brach was killed during the return to Cambridge, after stepping on a landmine.[14] Two days later, Worwick's condition turned out to be unsalvageable: Injuries from raider gunfire resulted in paralysis and internal bleeding. After Haylen reported him as suffering and with a less than 5% chance of recovery, Danse authorized her to euthanize the mortally wounded knight.[15]
Danse adopted a more cautious strategy, focusing on surveying Boston and its surrounding environs. No casualties were sustained between April and July, until Danse ran a reconaissance operation at grid reference A113: Boston International and Fort Strong. The airport was virtually empty, but Fort Strong was infested by super mutants. Danse hoped for Gladius to resupply at the fort's armory, but during the approach Knight-Sergeant Dawes was killed by the mutants and Danse had to order a general retreat again. Two retreats and three casualties in the span of a little over half a year did not cause Danse to abandon the mission, but he determined that the best way to deal with such locations in the future was with artillery and extreme prejudice.[16] Danse also started to develop insomnia and other symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder.[17]
By October, Gladius happened on the most important discovery of their expedition: Unusual energy readings on an extreme high-band spectrum frequency, sporadic, brief and isolated to very specific locations. He concluded they were unlikely to be pre-War in origin and had his team triangulate the signal and identify its origin, unaware that they were tracking the Institute's molecular relay and about to instigate a war between the Brotherhood and the scientists.[18] While the team completed the energy readings, they were unable to establish contact with Scabbard due to damage to the police station's antenna. With Haylen unsure of her ability to restore it without parts, Danse refocused his efforts on recovering the long range signal transmitter from the nearby ArcJet Systems, so that they could inform the Brotherhood, setting the war in motion.[19]
Danse becomes a full companion following Shadow of Steel provided the Sole Survivor enlists with the Brotherhood. He is fiercely loyal to the order and travels with the Sole Survivor to ensure their ideals are being upheld. As their relationship develops Danse confesses to being burdened by the losses of colleagues, friends and mentors killed by the many horrors of the wasteland. Unwilling to let their sacrifices be for naught, he asserts the Institute and its synths must be eradicated for the safety of mankind. He believes synths are the embodiment of technology spiraling out of control, and their existence could bring about the end of humanity. 
As the main story progresses the Sole Survivor will have an opportunity to hack into the Institute's mainframe. Should they provide the Brotherhood with a copy of this data it is confirmed through DNA analysis that Paladin Danse himself is a missing synth, designated M7-97. Danse goes AWOL and flees to Listening Post Bravo. Outraged by the apparent infiltration of his inner circle, Elder Maxson orders the Survivor to track Danse down and execute him.
Once located, a suicidal Danse is adamant he did not know he was a synth. The disgraced paladin then encourages the Survivor to carry out their orders, insisting that he ""must be the example, not the exception."" The Sole Survivor must then choose to execute Danse or convince him to leave the Commonwealth. If persuaded to run Danse will leave the bunker only to find that a suspicious Elder Maxson has followed the Sole Survivor to his hiding place. A confrontation will occur in which the Sole Survivor will again have to decide the synth's fate. Should Danse survive the events of Blind Betrayal he will be grateful and, with Maxson's promise not to have him hunted down, stays to aid the Sole Survivor in their mission.
When they rendezvous sometime later Danse is still coming to terms with his nature. Though grateful to the Sole Survivor for saving him, the sudden loss of his identity, memories and career leave him grasping for answers. The Sole Survivor can attempt to comfort him and, if so desired, may express a romantic interest. Danse will recoil at first, shocked the Sole Survivor could be in love with a synth but eventually admits to feeling the same way. He asks for patience as he works through his ""human emotions"" and vows to remain steadfast at his partner's side.
Danse is a strong, level-headed and loyal Brotherhood soldier who loves using his power armor. He wishes to think highly of humanity as it gives him something to believe in and fight for, commenting that he finds the Combat Zone to be a ""barbaric"" place. Despite this, he struggles with the idea of humanity achieving peace again, commenting that pre-War artifacts are ""more valuable than treasure"" and that they provide glimpses at moments in time that will never repeat. He is not a man of leisure, focusing on his service to the Brotherhood. As such, many activities are foreign to him: For example, Danse has never gone fishing and wonders if it's even possible.[20]
He believes that synths are an abuse of technology created by the Institute, as well as abominations. He is shown that he can be quite judgemental, disliking ghouls and super mutants. Danse is inconsistent with his approval in regards to how the Sole Survivor treats sapient ghouls. For example, he likes telling Kent Connolly not to sell himself short at the start of the Silver Shroud quest but hates it if the Survivor gives the Vault-Tec rep a place to live. Upon learning that he is a synth, Danse deeply struggles with accepting that his entire identity being a living lie. He then turns suicidal, considering himself a freak of nature who needs to die.
Danse utilizes an expansive vocabulary, often expressing simple thoughts in long and roundabout ways, despite stating that he is an orphan and never mentions formal schooling (aside from his training in the Brotherhood). This quirk is noted by Piper who attributes it to his being a synth.
Knight-Captain Cade believes Danse may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or a similar issue. The specific symptoms sighted are ""inability to sleep and a ""dull throubing pain in head."" All tests came back negative, so he deemed it psychological in nature.[21] However, these tests were made for human physiology which is in fact distinct from synths: Synths can sleep, but do not require it for proper functioning,[22] and they may experience hunger and tiredness.[23]
Danse has the authority to grant the Sole Survivor membership into the Brotherhood of Steel.
Paladin Danse can be acquired at the shop by any player character that has Charisma. When he is the active companion and there is another player character within two spaces, the owner can exhaust him to move the target character one space in any direction. If the owner has the Idolized trait when they do this, they will lose it.
When the player character performs the camp action, he will become unexhausted. However, if the player character does not have the Idolized trait, he must be discarded.",Paladin Danse,danse,maleboston,NPCMPaladinDanse,Synth,Male,,384589,161411,YetAnotherModder,100,27683,27683,0005DE4D,NPCMPaladinDanse,NPCMPaladinDanse,BoSPaladinDanse,BoSPaladinDanse,
/wiki/Haylen,"Scribe Haylen, registration HN-118FS,[1] is a field scribe of the Brotherhood of Steel, stationed at the Cambridge Police Station in¬†Fallout.
Sometime after the Brotherhood-Enclave War, as the Brotherhood began recruiting throughout the Capital Wasteland, Haylen was accepted into the organization with Rhys sponsoring her induction and Danse sponsoring her training.[2][3] Rhys took her under his wing during her training and during this time she began to believe that there was a possible romantic connection between them. However, when she asked him about it, he told her that the Brotherhood was the only thing that he cared about and the two never spoke of it again.[4]
She became a scribe, serving in the Brotherhood's Order of the Quill. By 2287, she, Danse, Rhys, and four other soldiers had been assigned together to form Recon Squad Gladius, tasked with investigating the Commonwealth after the loss of Recon Squad Artemis three years prior.[5]
The mission was difficult from the moment of their arrival; after establishing a stronghold at the Cambridge Police Station, Knights Worwick, Brach, Dawes, and Keane all perished from attacks by raiders, super mutants, and feral ghouls respectively. Worwick's death was especially hard on Haylen; she spent two days treating his wounds before Danse ordered her to put him out of his misery via an overdose of painkillers. Despite their losses, Haylen still carried out her assigned tasks, monitoring energy readings from an unknown source and modifying the police station's radio tower to eventually call in reinforcements.[6] She is first encountered during the quest Fire Support and is responsible for the emergency broadcast the Sole Survivor hears. Later on in the Brotherhood questline, she can also be found at Waypoint Echo along with a couple of Brotherhood troops during the quest Liberty Reprimed, and onboard the Prydwen during the quest Blind Betrayal. Afterward, she will return to the police station and continue tasking the Sole Survivor with recovering pre-war technology.
She has certain doubts about the Brotherhood's ideology and practice. She joined out of idealism, but it was quickly confronted by brutal, pragmatic tactics that define Maxson's doctrine. While Haylen continues to work for the Brotherhood, she's constantly doubting herself over the morality of her chosen path.[7]",Scribe Haylen,ScribeHaylen,ScribeHaylen,NPCFScribeHaylen,Human,Female,,384587,384575,YetAnotherModder,96.0,0005DE3F,0005DE3F,0005DE4B,NPCFScribeHaylen,NPCFScribeHaylen,BoSScribeHaylen,BoSScribeHaylen,
/wiki/Jon_Elwood,"Jon Elwood (known in-game as the Director) is a feral ghoul in the Commonwealth in 2287.
Jon Elwood, his wife Ericka, and Wilfred Bergman were all classmates in the Commonwealth Institute of Technology, and he often competed with Bergman to see who would be the better hacker; Bergman won. After they graduated, they co-founded Cambridge Polymer Labs, LLC in 2074 with help from Jon's connections ‚Äî namely Col. George Kemp, who provided them with research grants to continue their work on polymers for the U.S. military.[1] The lab's last contract before the Great War was the Nucleostrictive Lining Project, funded by the military to create improved polymer weaves for power armor.[2][3]
Just before the bombs struck, Jon received an ominous phone call from Col. Kemp regarding the project, urging him to keep the team inside the lab.[4] After the bombs fell, it became clear to Jon that the phone call had been a warning.[5] Due to the lab's external communications being disabled by the bombs, Jon took it upon himself to find a way to regain contact with the colonel. After locking his research team in the lab and telling them that any unusual noises they might hear were military training exercises, he left the labs in order to find a working ham radio. While he was successful in his search, he suffered from a high dose of radiation and a stray bullet to his shoulder.[2]
Jon regained contact with the military, but not with Kemp. His contacts relayed that extraction teams could only be spared to recover assets vital to the war effort and that attempts to be extracted without completing the project would result in Jon and the research team being executed for treason. Believing that completing the project was the only hope of being rescued, Jon continued to keep the team locked in the labs, lying that it was simply ""mandatory overtime."" The only person he told the truth to was Ericka, his wife.[2][6]
Isolation took its toll and Jon's lie began to unravel. The real problems began once Bergman realized that radiation was leaking into the lab, which Jon had also been aware of. Bergman sealed the isotope containment to try and stop the leak, unwittingly sealing a colleague inside and cutting off access to the isotopes needed to complete the project. He then began hacking into the system to take control away from Jon, refusing to be trapped by him any longer, attempting to activate the lab's automated defenses and fight his way out. Jon tried to counter Bergman's hacking attempts, but gradually lost strength as his wound worsened and went septic.[7][8]
Realizing he was dying, Jon left one final message for his wife to read in case of her success.[9] He was left unable to support Ericka and the researchers as they tried to ambush Bergman in his office, and they also ultimately perished, with Ericka killed by a gun rigged by Bergman and the remaining team succumbing to radiation poisoning or degenerating into feral ghouls. By 2287, Jon himself had also become a feral ghoul, still roaming his own office.
Molly, the lab's robotic greeter and recruiter, alludes to improper workplace conduct concerns related to Jon. According to Molly, Jon was on thin ice with his company's HR department for not respecting his employees' personal space, as well as a particular incident involving his secretary. Because of this, HR forced him to attend sensitivity training.[10][11][12]",Director,maleghoul,maleghoul,maleghoul,Feral ghoul,Male,,167855,167854,YetAnotherModder,84,00028FAE,00028FAE,00028FAF,,,DN015_Director,,

/wiki/Wilfred_Bergman,"Doctor Wilfred ""Wil"" Bergman was a CIT graduate and security administrator, co-owner of Cambridge Polymer Labs, LLC, and a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. He can be found as a feral ghoul in the Cambridge Polymer Labs in 2287.
Wilfred was an old friend of Jon Elwood, the director of Cambridge Polymer Labs, going back to their days as students at CIT competing against each other as hackers; Bergman was the better of the two. After graduation, they co-founded Cambridge Polymer Labs, LLC, along with Jon's wife Ericka, with help from the connections Jon had made.[1]
Bergman was also a security administrator for his former university, having authority over account credentials management and working to ensure the university's Code Defender system remained foolproof. To that ends, he was highly critical of his university colleague Dean Vernon's decision to give Dr. Williams admin rights, as he was not a member of their core team.[2][3]
Later, he joined the U.S. Armed Forces, received military training, and participated in the Anchorage Reclamation before returning from service in 2077.
Bergman was present within Cambridge Polymer Labs when the Great War struck and was able to survive, but was locked inside the labs by Jon, who reasoned that they would only survive in the outside world if they could get a military escort, and the only way that would happen would be if they finished the Nucleostrictive Lining Project. However, Bergman, frustrated by their lack of progress on the project and realizing that the bomb strikes had damaged the labs' isotope containment, began planning an escape attempt, refusing to be killed by what he saw as Jon's tyranny. By mid-January 2078, he had locked the researchers out of the Isotope Containment area, also unwittingly trapping Mary Goodman inside.[4][5] Meanwhile, he locked himself into a lab and attempted to hack and activate the facility's defense systems to unlock the exit, intending to fight his way out. The other researchers believed his plan would end up killing all of them and begged him to see reason, but he ignored their pleas. They infiltrated his room and managed to stop him, but Ericka was killed, and with no way to finish the project, the rest of the team soon succumbed to the radiation from the leaking Isotope Containment.[6] Bergman himself remained in his office and also fell victim to the radiation, turning into a feral ghoul.
Ironically, Bergman's earlier comments about approaching the project from an ""oblique angle"" ultimately inspired Ericka to be able to solve the team's problems with the Nucleostrictive Lining Project, but Bergman's actions instead doomed them to failure by blocking them from accessing the U-238 sample needed to finish it.[7]",Feral Ghoul,maleghoul,maleghoul,maleghoul,Feral ghoul,Male,,667250,1769927,YetAnotherModder,84,001B01C7,001B01C7,000A2E72,,,DN015FeralGhoulAmbush_Bergman,,

/wiki/Emogene_Cabot,"Emogene Cabot is a member of the Cabot family living in Boston in 2287.
Emogene Cabot is the youngest and most flirtatious member of the Cabot family. Like her mother Wilhelmina and brother Jack, she uses a special serum derived from her father's blood to defy aging and has been doing so since she was 32 years old.[2][3][1] She was well known for her beauty before the Great War and was a three-time ""Miss Boston"" pageant winner.[4] She was equally well known in the family for her numerous lovers, such as Robert, a federal employee who informed the family of the delicate geopolitical situation in the Sino-American War.[5][6]
During the Great War, while Jack and Edward Deegan were away at Parsons State Insane Asylum, Emogene thwarted a takeover of Cabot House by Anders, one of their employees, who tried to forced the family out of the house at gunpoint. Instead, Emogene killed Anders and subsequently took charge of the house, restoring power and defending the property.[7][8]
While appearing to be the most frivolous and irresponsible of the Cabots, Emogene is highly empathetic and self-aware about her family's privileged status compared to the outside world,[9][10] viewing her mother as perpetually in denial and her brother as too absorbed in his work. She is the only one of the Cabots who has tried to stop taking the serum, but could not bring herself to continue, and knows that now that they have had a taste of longevity, they would never willingly give it up even if they believe they could.[11] She has become existentially bored and describes herself as ""just going through the motions,"" privately suspecting that Jack has also given up on curing their father.[12] However, this has not stopped Emogene from continuing her rebellious ways, despite her family's attempts to dissuade her from leaving the house. She especially dislikes Jack's practice of sending hired thugs to bring her home, viewing it as his attempts to control her life.[4][13]
Most recently, she took an interest in Brother Thomas, but this quickly fell apart when he turned out to be part of a cult. When she refused to join, he locked her in his office to change her mind. Meanwhile, Emogene is content to wait for Thomas to change his mind instead.[14]
The Sole Survivor is asked by Jack to look for her during Emogene Takes a Lover. Upon rescuing her from the Pillars of the Community, she appears to be far older than her brother. With a Charisma check, she can be asked about this and will explain that she has not taken the serum that keeps the Cabots looking young in some time. She refuses to be escorted home, preferring to have a drink first.
After the completion of Emogene Takes a Lover, she can be found in the Third Rail, looking much younger.

/wiki/Cait,"Cait is a cage fighter trapped in the Combat Zone in¬†Fallout, fighting for the amusement of the raiders that have occupied the arena. Should the Sole Survivor clear out the arena, her employer will transfer her contract to them, making her available as a companion.
She is approximately around the age of 26, as it is mentioned she spent 18 years with her parents, 5 with the slavers, and 3 at the Combat Zone.
Cait was born into a distant and abusive family of Irish1 descent in 2260 or 2261, her parents would routinely abuse her both physically and verbally. She attempted to run away twice, the first time she did it, they locked her in a shed outside of the house. The second time, they broke one of her legs.[1] Cait eventually became convinced she was a mistake, due to the constant abuse, but deluded herself into thinking that they loved her enough not to kick her out of the house. The illusion was shattered once her eighteenth birthday came: They had slapped a shock collar around her neck and sold her into slavery, all without a hint of regret.[2][3]
For the next five years, Cait was used as an entertainment slave for a variety of purposes she refuses to detail. While it wrecked her emotionally and warped her personality, Cait developed significant resentment towards her captors but eventually learned some tricks of their trade. Stealing caps from sleeping men after they used her, she eventually managed to buy her freedom. With 23 years' worth of pent-up fury, she tracked down her parents and gunned them down in bloody revenge.[4][5]
After everything was said and done, Cait took to alcohol and chems to help forget her past. She joined the Combat Zone as a cage fighter and fought to provide her with the funds to buy everything she needed to forget. The point of the fighting wasn't truly to provide for herself monetarily. She hated everyone, herself the most, and the violence, pain, wounds, and Psycho addiction were ways to punish herself and hopefully find death.[6] Unfortunately, Cait proved too tough to beat, even when raiders took control of the combat zone and it got decidedly more lethal. Those who didn't keep their head on a swivel were liable to be sucker-punched and robbed in the best of circumstances. Cait herself learned that, short of buying friends, she would have been a victim waiting to be preyed upon. The teacher of that vital lesson was a raider named Stratton, who abandoned her to be beaten by raiders after she refused to sleep with him.[7]
By the time the Sole Survivor comes, Cait has been a cage fighter for three years, two of them under raider management‚Äîall with a hundred victories to her name.[8] As the Sole Survivor enters the Combat Zone and defeats the raiders, Tommy Lonegan offers them Cait's contract because of her self-destructive reliance on Psycho.
Cait puts up a deceptively convincing tough Irish gal act, but beneath this exterior is a broken woman with a lifetime of misery behind her.[9] Cait is thoroughly paranoid of everyone around her as everyone she's known deeply has betrayed her in some way. This has caused an inherent mistrust in anyone, especially those doing selfless offers of kindness. The only relationship she currently trusts is trade relationships, either through caps or other services.[10] She is also deeply regretful of many of the choices she's made in life, questioning if the brutality she's known all her life is truly the only way to settle things.[11]
As an escape and a way to forget the traumas of her life, Cait has taken to both the bottle and the needle (specifically psycho) and has been using both for several years.[12] Because of this prolonged usage, she is incapable of being cured of her psycho addiction through normal means, either a doctor or Addictol.[13]
Despite her life being a seemingly unceasing march of adversity, disappointment, and horror (coupled with Psycho reliance and the accompanying progressive health damage[14]), Cait refuses to take the easy way out. Staring down the barrel of her shotgun more than once, she has yet to pull the trigger. Instead, she pursued the death she couldn't give herself in the ring, crushed to death by one of the hundreds of opponents she had fought.[6] But she persevered, hoping and praying to find a single decent scrap of humanity in her life and in the world. Perhaps the Sole Survivor will be that scrap.[12]",Cait,Cait,Cait,NPCFCait,Human,Female,,496389,496201,YetAnotherModder,100.0,79249,79249,79305,,NPCFCait,CompanionCait,CompanionCait,

Should the Sole Survivor kill Tommy's raider patrons, he will offer Cait's contract to them, as without clients she becomes a liability due to not bringing in caps.

In the month leading up to the arrival of the caravan of survivors from the Quincy Massacre in Concord, Gristle and his raiders had raided three caravans. Upon hearing from Freddie about the group led by Preston Garvey, who he described as ""some joker in a cowboy hat,"" he excitedly went to request more men from Jared to attack them, and Jared was only too happy to agree. Jared's reason for authorizing the raid was because he wanted to capture Mama Murphy, a member of the group, in order to gain her precognitive powers for himself. Meanwhile, Gristle simply wanted to claim Garvey's hat.[2][3]
Gristle's attack forced the Quincy survivors to retreat to the Museum of Freedom in Concord, where they have barricaded themselves in while Gristle and his raiders besiege them from all sides.
When Freedom Calls: Gristle, who leads the raiders attacking Preston Garvey's group in the Museum of Freedom, must be killed. Gristle himself only appears during the second and final wave of the raid.

/wiki/Jun_Long,"Jun Long is a settler traveling with Preston Garvey and his group in the Commonwealth in 2287.
A refugee from Quincy following Preston Garvey's lead, Jun has lost everything. When Gunners attacked Quincy, he fled the town with his wife, son Kyle, and little more than the shirts on their backs. Taking refuge in Lexington, the group was eventually forced out by a combination of feral ghouls and raiders encroaching on the town. With their numbers steadily dwindling down to almost nothing, losing over three-fourths of their number in a month including his son, Jun is distraught.[1] While his wife's reaction to their victimization manifested as fury and anger, Jun became a wreck. Paranoid, skittish, and rapidly losing weight, he is a shadow of his former self, permanently scarred by his recent experiences, especially the loss of his only child. Jun has even gone so far as to ask Mama Murphy to communicate with Kyle using the Sight but she says that doing so is beyond its ability.[2]",Jun Long,maleeventoned,maleboston,NPCMJunLong,Human,Male,,107739,106459,YetAnotherModder,84,00019FDB,00019FDB,0001A4DB,NPCMJunLong,NPCMJunLong,JunLong,JunLong,
/wiki/Mama_Murphy,"Mama Murphy is a chem-addicted fortune teller, traveling with Preston Garvey and his group of settlers in the Commonwealth in 2287.
Mama Murphy is an elderly psychic seer specializing in ""The Sight,"" a supernatural power that she claims is sourced from chems. She uses the chems to induce a trance-like state in which she claims to see fragments of the past and the future, and even nearby events in the present.[1][2] Mama Murphy has had her power ever since she was young, and she has gotten into all sorts of adventures because of it. She uses her power out of a desire to protect the people she cares for, providing warnings of danger and advice on which courses of action to take.[3] She knows that her chem use takes a toll on her health, but she believes that the help she can provide to her friends is far more important. She was convinced once to stop, in her youth, by a ""handsome young boy"" she met who believed her power caused her to be a ""slave to something evil[.]"" However, that caused them to become vulnerable without her power in an unspecified situation when they ""need[ed] it most."" This convinced her to never stop using her power, and especially now that she is old, she believes her health is not important compared to the lives of others.[4][5]
Mama Murphy claims that she was once a strong and ruthless fighter, specialized in unarmed combat. She claims that she once ripped the head off of a raider using just her bare hands, earning her the nickname ""Murphy the Madwoman.""[6][7] She also claims to have killed a deathclaw with just one bullet, and to have once had a bounty on her head in her youth from a raider she had double-crossed.[8][9]
Hailing from Quincy, her precognitive powers (and her related chem usage) were well-known to the townspeople, with Sturges and Mayor Jackson taking care of her and confiscating her chems to try and prevent her from overuse. Though not everyone believed she was sane, her visions came true enough of the time for her to be taken seriously. As such, when she predicted the town would come under siege, Sturges and Mayor Jackson took it seriously enough to call for help from the Commonwealth Minutemen. Mama Murphy hoped that alerting the mayor would change the outcome of the disaster she saw in her vision, but ultimately this did not change the future.[10][11][3] In the resulting Quincy Massacre, the Gunners overwhelmed the town and the garrisonned Minutemen (with help from a defector,) and Mama Murphy was forced to flee the town alongside Preston Garvey and the few remaining survivors.[12]
The survivors traveled the wastes looking for sanctuary, but one disaster after another kept pushing them further northwest until they ended up in Concord. They found no respite there, either, attacked by raiders who tracked them from Lexington. Now trapped and besieged inside the Museum of Freedom, Mama Murphy is one of the last five survivors, alongside Preston, Sturges, and Jun and Marcy Long.[12] She continues to hold out hope, having seen in a vision that Sanctuary Hills would be a safe place for them to finally settle down and rest.[13]
Mama Murphy was actually the reason for the attack by the raiders from Lexington. She had spent time with their leader, Jared, when he was young, and foresaw with the Sight that he would be kidnapped by raiders and become a ""monster."" When this came true, Jared became convinced of Mama Murphy's powers and tried to gain them for himself using chems, to no success. When he was told that a woman matching her description was in Lexington, he was determined to capture her so that he could discover her secrets, and sent his lieutenant Gristle to assault the settlers and bring her to him.[14][15]",Mama Murphy,femaleold,femaleboston,NPCFMamaMurphy,Human(psychic),Female,,107737,106456,YetAnotherModder,84,00019FD8,00019FD8,0001A4D9,,NPCFMamaMurphy,MamaMurphy,MamaMurphy,
/wiki/Marcy_Long,"Marcy Long is a settler traveling with Preston Garvey and his group in the Commonwealth in 2287. Marcy is first met taking refuge in the Museum of Freedom, Concord, in the company of the aforementioned minuteman and what is left of his crew.
A refugee from Quincy following Preston Garvey's lead, Marcy has steadily seen everything in her life go to pieces. Originally a settler in Quincy, Marcy was married to Jun Long, with a child, Kyle, and a prosperous store. Both were skeptical of Mama Murphy's sudden visions of Quincy's destruction, cutting her off, but not before Mayor Jackson requested Minutemen assistance.[1]
Although Jun considered the Minutemen freeloaders, he did a 180 when Colonel Ezra Hollis arrived, routing a Gunner detachment trying to take Quincy by surprise. Marcy, on the other hand, was concerned that despite the rout, there were too few minutemen to defend the town against a larger, more coordinated attack. Hollis' assurances did not ease her mind.[2]
When Gunners attacked Quincy again, blowing up the highway and attacking with the height advantage, she was proven right. Only a small group managed to get away under Preston's lead, including Marcy, her husband, son, and shirts on their backs. The desperate flight across the Commonwealth took its toll: Gunners chased them away from Quincy, feral ghouls from Lexington and eventually, raiders cornered the few remaining survivors at Concord.[3]
Having lost everything, including her only son, Marcy is overcome with bitter grief. It manifests primarily as anger: A mixture of various emotions, including furious, unrelenting hatred towards raiders, paranoia and excessive caution (in fact, she is reluctant to settle in any permanent area, due to fear of it being overrun again), and irritation. It takes a great deal to improve her spirits, but even then, the string of bad fortune and losing her only child has left her permanently scarred.",Marcy Long,femaleboston,femaleboston,NPCFMarcyLong,Human,Female,,107738,106460,YetAnotherModder,84,00019FDC,00019FDC,0001A4DA,,NPCFMarcyLong,MarcyLong,MarcyLong,
/wiki/Preston_Garvey,"Preston Garvey is one of the last surviving members of the Commonwealth Minutemen, a volunteer defense militia operating in the Commonwealth in 2287. Should the Sole Survivor rescue him from the Museum of Freedom and assume leadership of the Minutemen, he will offer his services as a companion.
During his childhood, the Minutemen were personal heroes of Preston Garvey, as he observed them to be the ""only good guys around."" Because of this, Garvey enlisted with a company of Minutemen under Colonel Ezra Hollis at the age of seventeen. He grew to be an avid believer in the Minutemen's ideals of fellowship and justice, feeling like he was truly making a difference. He says that he had ""a few good years there,"" fighting for a cause bigger than just himself.[1] Things began to change for the worse in 2282, when the Minutemen's General, Joe Becker, was killed in combat[citation needed], causing the disparate groups within the faction to fall into infighting. By 2287, Hollis' company, including Garvey, were one of the last active groups of Minutemen still protecting settlements and answering calls for help put out by the Commonwealth citizens.
In 2287, Sturges, an inhabitant of the influential trading hub at Quincy - requested the aid of the Minutemen after having heard one of Mama Murphy‚Äôs visions, which foresaw the town being surrounded and massacred.[2] Although the majority saw Murphy as a burned-out chem addict, Sturges went behind his fellow citizens to invoke the protection of the Minutemen.[3] Preston joined Hollis on a mission to rescue Quincy, where they found the Gunners besieging the town.
The Minutemen dispersed the Gunner lines and were welcomed by the citizens of Quincy while the Gunners temporarily retreated.[4] When arriving, Preston was one of the Minutemen who helped the settlers build up more proper defenses for the town. An ex-Minutemen veteran named Clint had revealed himself to Colonel Hollis as the leader of the invading force. Hollis felt extreme anger at this betrayal.[5] The citizens expressed confusion and frustration. Clint sought to establish terms of surrender for Quincy and its defenders; these terms were summarily rejected by Hollis.[6][7]
While the subsequent events are not explicitly recorded in text, the outcome for the Minutemen is broadly established by dialogue with Preston and various other wastelanders: the Minutemen requested support, which did not arrive; the Gunners overwhelmed the defenders and murdered nearly all of the civilians;[7] Col. Hollis, the linchpin of the long-dwindling Minutemen cause, died fighting.[8] The event is known as the Quincy Massacre and it catalyzed the disintegration of the remaining settlements under Minutemen protection.
Consequently, Preston gathered the few remaining Quincy civilians and loyal members of the Minutemen and fled. Several of the refugees lost their lives at the hands of the Gunners before the group shook their pursuit at Jamaica Plain, reducing his group to just over ten.[9] The refugees next moved to Lexington. Regrettably, as Preston testifies, Lexington was filled with feral ghouls. This led to only eight survivors making it out. Eventually, the group moved to Concord, where they took shelter in the Museum of Freedom, only to find themselves under the constant predation of raiders, who unbeknownst to the group were under orders from their leader, Jared, to acquire Mama Murphy.[10]
By the time the Sole Survivor arrives to help Preston, he is leading the last pocket of people under the protection of the Minutemen. His group numbers only five - himself, Mama Murphy, Sturges, and Jun and Marcy Long - a mere fraction of the original twenty who escaped Quincy under his guidance. Believing he has failed everyone who had ever relied on him and everything he thought he knew about the Minutemen being a lie, Garvey is at the end of his rope. It's only because of those four people that he puts on a brave face; in reality, he's not sure if they will get out of Concord alive, but that's acceptable to him, believing death is what he deserves and what he actually wants. Deep down, although not actively suicidal, Garvey has given up hope for himself and the Minutemen and doesn't care if he lives or dies.[11] If Preston Garvey is saved he will mention he is the last Minuteman standing, but not the last Minuteman alive as there were many former Minutemen out there who gave it up in disgust or turned away from the faction's ideals (examples of this being Clint, James Wire, and Ronnie Shaw).

/wiki/Isolde,"Mother Isolde is the spiritual leader of a peaceful sect of the Children of Atom living near the Commonwealth in the late 2280s.[1][RPG 1] Her congregation are the only human presence in the Glowing Sea region. Her village, called the Crater of Atom, was built at the detonation site of the high-yield nuke originally witnessed by the Sole Survivor two hundred years prior. Isolde once had a daughter named Dawn, who grew up within the cult alongside Brother Ogden.[RPG 2]
The circumstances under which Isolde came to preside over the Crater are unspecified. The time of this group's arrival and their prior associations are not clarified, though Isolde has been a member of the group long enough to raise her daughter to adulthood.[RPG 2] There is no clear direct connection between this group and the historic Church at Megaton, though Isolde is known to respect the offshoot sect who live on the Island to the far north.[2]
By 2287, the settlement is well-established, consisting of post-War carpentry and welded metal, with some large items of pre-War furniture.
No later than 2286, the Last Son of Atom joined Isolde's flock, claiming to have served Confessor Cromwell at Megaton. He resided there for some time, until Isolde exiled him for heresy. Several of her followers left with him, forming the basis of his sect.[RPG 1] Isolde still harbors guilt for having allowed this stranger to influence her village. She came to consider the Last Son a heretic and false prophet, leading the Children astray with promises of awakening Atom and opening gateways to other universes.[RPG 3][RPG 4]
Sister Dawn also left to follow the Last Son, and appeared to grow very close to him during this time.[RPG 2] However, she was only following this heretic to covertly monitor him on behalf of her mother. In pursuit of this mission, she remained close to him, even as he grew erratic from excessive chem use.[RPG 5] Ultimately, the cruel warlord captured her and transformed her into a titan known as the Great Glowing One. Dawn was set loose to stalk the Glowing Sea, devouring other glowing ones and growing larger.[RPG 6] Ultimately, under Isolde's auspices, a group of outsiders led by an Atomite guide hunted down the Great Glowing One and ended her suffering.
The Last Son was able to uncover an ancient buried city in the Glowing Sea, and declared it the City of Atom.[Non-game 1][RPG 7] Isolde condemns these cryptic primordial ruins, and considers the site unrelated to her deity.[RPG 8] The Buried City collapsed in the Winter of 2286.
Recently, Mother Isolde has allowed Brian Virgil, a super mutant hiding from the Institute, to take shelter in a nearby cave. She attests that he has ""sought refuge with Atom,"" but his presence is seen as an affront to Atom by some of her followers. She dispatched Brother Hoberman to assess Virgil as a threat. Under her advisement, the scout resolved to avoid interfering with him, but remained on standby for future orders.[3]",Mother Isolde,FemaleEvenToned,FemaleEvenToned,FemaleEvenToned,Human,Female,,1235785,1235784,YetAnotherModder,100.0,0012DB48,0012DB48,0012DB49,FemaleEvenToned,FemaleEvenToned,CoAMotherIsolde,CoAMotherIsolde,

Although McDonough enjoys popularity with some of the citizenry, others are not as charitable toward him, with Piper Wright in particular feuding with the mayor over her publication of Publick Occurrences.
In reality, McDonough is a synth infiltrator, unit designation M7-62,[3] working for the Institute, having been replaced at some point in the past.
A larger than life figure in both the figurative and the literal sense of the word, McDonough has been running Diamond City for years, maintaining it as a prosperous center of commerce for the Commonwealth. In reality, the city's mayor is an Institute plant, a synth infiltrator who monitors developments in the Commonwealth and compiles reports on matters of possible interest to the organization.[4] His only point of contact was Conrad Kellogg, as the Institute lacked another way to receive the messages from him without causing an uproar in the city.[5]
The human McDonough was the brother of John Hancock, the leader of Goodneighbor, and the son of Patrick and Martha McDonough.[2] He was described by Hancock as ""the standard big brother - entitled, punchy, liked to shove rotten tatoes down my shirt and slap my back.""[1] He was abducted and replaced by the Institute sometime before 2282.[6][7] The goal was simple: To install an Institute agent at the head of the largest settlement in the Commonwealth. The decision to pursue a political career came as a surprise to Hancock, but he did not stand in his brother's way, at least not until McDonough started campaigning for the 2282 election.[8]
He ran on the Mankind for McDonough ticket, promising to remove ghouls from Diamond City.[9] His program was supported by the upper stands residents and eventually earned him the mayoral position. His anti-ghoul decree was enacted immediately, with McDonough's inaugural speech triggering an exodus of ghoul families. Hancock tried to protest, but the mayor simply replied that, while he has no ill will towards ghouls, he could not defy the will of the people and smiled, forever estranging the two brothers. Hancock no longer recognized the brother he grew up with.[6]
John left Diamond City and his bigoted brother. He tried to help the victims of the ghoul exodus, who had been forced to survive in the desolate city, and resettle them in Goodneighbor. However, most of them could not get used to its lifestyle and eventually disappeared, with John saying that Diamond City residents ""signed [the] death warrants"" of ghoul families.[10] Meanwhile, as mayor of Diamond City, the synth has been carrying out a mission to infiltrate the city and its inhabitants, who are oblivious to his true nature as an Institute agent. The synthetic mayor took efforts to conceal his secret allegiance to the scientific community from his people, even though an observant journalist, Piper Wright, had caught a whiff of his plans and published the information in a news story, titled ""The Synthetic Truth."" Piper has gotten on the bad side of the mayor as a result of her sensationalizing rumors of him being a synth, which has led to her receiving a temporary ban from city limits.[11] His other issue is that his anti-ghoul rhetoric is running out of steam, especially with the foundation of the Slog. Peaceful, prosperous ghoul settlements will inevitably breed people who don't consider ghouls monsters and eventually allow someone to challenge McDonough's bigoted policies and remove him from power. In his view, the Institute should consider engineering a situation where the ghouls are ""less friendly.""[9]
McDonough's own long term goal is to transfer within the SRB and become a courser. He is not aware that his synth body would be incompatible with the lifestyle of a courser, and his handlers view his level of independence as too much of a liability. Furthermore, his handlers consider him expendable: If he is ever outed as a synth, he would be cut loose with an estimated survival time of two weeks.[3]
McDonough has been a popular mayor among merchants and the wealthy Upper Stands residents, due to his emphasis on keeping Diamond City prosperous and safe, but something of a conflicted figure among the Lower Field population due to the circumstances of his election and his refusal to investigate the recent spate of kidnappings allegedly orchestrated by the Institute, which has sparked mass paranoia within the community.",Mayor McDonough,maleold,maleboston,NPCMMayorMcDonough,Synth,Male,,12041,12040,YetAnotherModder,84,00002F08,00002F08,00002F09,NPCMMayorMcDonough,NPCMMayorMcDonough,MayorMcDonough,MayorMcDonough,

The proprietor of the junk shop known as Diamond City Surplus, Myrna is a gifted tinkerer with a penchant for restoring old robots. She suffers from a strong paranoia of synths, and as result is an outspoken anti-Institute conspiracy theorist. She is highly suspicious of synths shopping at her store, let alone browsing her merchandise.

In response to the rumors of kidnappings by the Institute, Myrna has reprogrammed Percy, an old Mister Handy unit she had salvaged and restored, to handle the night shift so that she can safely sleep at night, due to her fear of the ""synth propaganda"" that perpetrates at dusk.

/wiki/Nelson_Latimer,"Nelson Latimer is a wealthy resident of Diamond City in 2287. He is the son of Malcolm Latimer.
Nelson is a wealthy resident of Diamond City's Upper Stands, living in the Latimer residence. His position comes from his father, Malcolm, who is one of the most influential people in Diamond City. Nelson, knowing this, proclaims himself as an equally important member of Diamond City society.[1][2] Others, like Henry Cooke, see him instead as a spoiled and arrogant young man who throws around his father's money to inflate his own ego. Cooke notes that Nelson even envisions himself as an up-and-coming criminal mastermind.[3][4]
To those ends, Nelson is affiliated with some of the shadier players in Diamond City and Goodneighbor. In partnership with Cooke, Nelson has business dealings with Marowski and his gangsters. Together, they have a scheme to smuggle chems into Diamond City in order to avoid paying local taxes on chems imposed by Mayor McDonough. Cooke arranges periodical meetings near Back Street Apparel, where Nelson uses his money to buy chems from Marowski's representative Trish.[5] This arrangement has worked for some time, but recently, Nelson is starting to try and cut Cooke out of their business, no longer believing he is necessary.[6][7][8]

/wiki/Paul_Pembroke,"Paul Pembroke is a resident of Diamond City in 2287. He is the husband of Darcy Pembroke and the father of Pete Pembroke. He can initially be found inside the Colonial Taphouse, confronting Henry Cooke.
Twenty years ago, Paul was a robber who took part in a massive heist on Marowski's chem warehouse in Quincy alongside his friends Malcolm Latimer and Henry Cooke. After they split their heist rewards, Cooke gave a photo of the event to Paul, who has kept it with him ever since.[1] Marowski put a huge bounty on the robbers, but he never found out who they were.[2] Paul then married Darcy, who was at least partly attracted by his newfound wealth (though she did not know about his involvement in the event.) He promised that he would fulfill her dream of someday making it to the Upper Stands of Diamond City.[3][4]
However, Paul eventually grew distant from his former partners. Both of them used their money and became successful, while Paul made a series of bad decisions and lost most of his money. His ensuing efforts to regain wealth, including various disreputable and potentially dangerous get-rich-quick schemes, have also not had any luck.[5][6] He became jealous and began to feel that Malcolm and Cooke were looking down on him for his incompetence, and he ended up alienating his friends, leaving himself isolated.[7][8]
Paul's marriage also worsened. Tired of Paul's failures, Darcy began complaining to Cooke and eventually even started an affair with him. Paul is aware that his wife is cheating on him with his former friend and is none too happy about it.[7][9]
¬πOnly if Paul takes part in the heist during Diamond City Blues, survives, and is given a 50-50 split
If the Sole Survivor refuses to help Paul confront Cooke, he will head off to do so by himself. If he is followed into the Colonial Taphouse, the confrontation will play out as normal despite Diamond City Blues not having started.
Depending on player actions, there are a number of outcomes for Paul following Diamond City Blues.
Paul has a special set of interactions regarding Colette, Cooke's daughter, who appears in Diamond City following Diamond City Blues. These interactions depend on Cooke's fate as well as whether or not he was angered by being given an unequal share of the chem heist rewards.

/wiki/Piper_Wright,"Piper Wright is a reporter living in Diamond City in 2287, running the local newspaper Publick Occurrences with her younger sister, Nat. She will eventually offer her services as a companion to the Sole Survivor, either after they agree to an interview or after finishing Reunions.
Piper grew up in a small community on the outskirts of the Commonwealth with Nat and their father, a member of the local militia. After her father was found dead under suspicious circumstances, Piper learned that he had discovered a raider plot to sack the town. His superior, Captain Mayburn, arranged to leave the main gate open and unguarded one night to allow raiders access in exchange for a cut of the loot and had Piper's father murdered to keep him silent.[2]
The local authorities did not believe her claims and refused to investigate. Piper then created and circulated wanted posters featuring the captain and a list of his crimes. The conspicuously public accusation got the attention of the town's mayor, who accepted Piper's evidence. The settlers, outraged by the story, exiled Mayburn. When the raiders eventually showed up expecting the gate to be wide open, they instead encountered prepared defenses by alerted townsfolk and were driven away.[2]
With both of their parents gone and Nat too young to work, Piper relied mainly on kindness and charity to survive, eventually saving enough money to relocate herself and her sister to Diamond City.[3] However, life in the ""big city"" provided its own share of challenges; at the time of their arrival, Diamond City was plagued by corruption, lax security, and failing infrastructure. Frustrated with this state of affairs and increasingly desperate to enact change, Piper founded the newspaper Publick Occurrences to raise awareness of the city‚Äôs problems.[4]
Her career was fraught with danger and intrigue from the outset. Shortly after founding the Publick, an article she wrote exposing the efforts of a caravan cartel to drive up food prices made her the target of a poisoning at the Dugout Inn, which she narrowly survived by chugging Vadim Bobrov's moonshine straight from the still to induce vomiting.[5] In a later incident, an investigation into irradiated drinking water at Bunker Hill led her to be kidnapped by the Church of the Children of Atom, who would have killed her as a human sacrifice had she not faked a vision of Atom and been subsequently initiated into the cult.[1] Piper also regularly fell afoul of Diamond City security during her investigations, to the point that their lockup came to be nicknamed ""the Piper Suite"" for her frequent stays in it.[6]
Piper‚Äôs activism and investigative fervor ultimately bore fruit; whether they agreed with her or not, citizens read her newspaper in droves, and many of the issues she brought to light were addressed.[7] However, this success came at a cost to Piper‚Äôs personal life. Following the release of the Publick‚Äôs first edition, many in the city who Piper had once considered friends and confidants became distant, and she gained a reputation across the Commonwealth as a ‚Äúnosy snoop.‚Äù[8] Public opinion of the paper slowly but surely soured, with many citizens writing in to complain about the negative tone of its reporting, and Piper began to feel deeply alienated from the community.
This alienation reached its peak with the publication of an article titled ""The Synthetic Truth."" Though the article largely consisted of a retrospective on the Broken Mask incident of 2229 and an interview with the event‚Äôs last surviving eyewitness, Eustace Hawthorne, it also contained thinly-veiled accusations that the city‚Äôs mayor, McDonough, was a synth infiltrator acting on behalf of the Institute.[9] Though privately certain in her accusations, Piper lacked any solid evidence for them, and McDonough subsequently had Piper thrown out of the city by security.
Despite her temporary exile, Piper remains steadfast in her determination to protect the city and expose the mayor‚Äôs wrongdoings. By the time of the Sole Survivor‚Äôs arrival at Diamond City, she can be found at the city‚Äôs gate, badgering Danny Sullivan via intercom and demanding to be readmitted to the city,[10] ultimately succeeding by convincing him that the Sole Survivor is a trader from Quincy carrying enough supplies to stock Diamond City Surplus for a month.[11]
Piper is a rather lonely woman who feels isolated in Diamond City. She has a strong drive to better the world and does not want to be complacent, causing her to become a writer in order to try to reduce the corruption within the town. Piper has a rapport with Nick Valentine as they both are investigators. Her tendency to find the latest scoop and the truth can cause others to find her nosy and annoying, however, resulting in her having few friends. She is highly perceptive, however, and was able to deduce the mayor was a synth. She tends to enjoy sarcasm.
Despite multiple death threats and an assassination attempt, finding herself in sticky situations is a point of pride for Piper, who feels getting into trouble is just part of chasing the truth.[6] Adding to her reckless nature, she may also be seen smoking occasionally. She is shown to not be above lying and manipulating others in order to get what she wants, such as when she tried to use the Sole Survivor to regain access to Diamond City after being banned from the town. Ironically, she generally dislikes it when the Sole Survivor lies.
While distrustful of the Institute, Piper is still sympathetic to the plight of synths, especially runaway synths, due to her interactions with Nick. Piper mentions Nick is the only synth she has met that did not seem to have a ""screw loose"" and at one point, Nick sat down to talk to her about why synths are different than typical robots.

Often going by his last name, Cooke is also an associate of chem trafficker Marowski. He can initially be found inside the Colonial Taphouse.
Cooke is the bartender of the Colonial Taphouse bar in Diamond City's upper stands, favored by the city's wealthier residents. He has an affair with Darcy Pembroke, even though she is already married and has a son. This has soured his relationship with Darcy's husband Paul. He and Paul were once close friends, but they are now at odds over Cooke's affair with Darcy and their differing financial states.[1] Cooke himself also has a daughter, Colette, though it has been a while since the last time he communicated with her.[2]
Cooke keeps many secrets, but his biggest secret is the story of his success. Twenty years ago, he robbed Marowski's chem warehouse in Quincy alongside his then-friends Paul Pembroke and Malcolm Latimer, dealing the kingpin a major blow. He even gave a photo of the event to Paul, who has kept it ever since. Marowski does not know that Cooke was one of the culprits of the heist.[3][4] Cooke used his heist money to buy the Colonial Taphouse, thus securing himself a steady income.[5]
Nowadays, Cooke plays a dangerous game: doing business with the man he robbed. Partnered with Malcolm Latimer's son Nelson, he is in an arrangement with Marowski to smuggle chems into Diamond City as a way to circumvent Mayor McDonough's hefty chem taxes. Cooke arranges their meetings with Marowski's representative Trish, while Latimer provides the cash to purchase the chems.[6] Cooke personally dislikes Nelson, but considers him useful for his money.[7] However, this arrangement is becoming unstable. Cooke believes Nelson is trying to cut him out, while he is also starting to owe money to Marowski.[8][9]
Cooke is also an informant for the Institute, feeding information to the Synth Retention Bureau on the whereabouts of fugitive Gen-3's in return for caps.[10]

/wiki/Crocker,"Doc Crocker is a facial reconstruction surgeon operating in Diamond City in 2287.
Alongside Dr. Sun, Crocker runs the Mega surgery center in Diamond City. He is the resident plastic surgeon, while his colleague provides routine medical care. Crocker is a skilled surgeon, yet he cares more about the appearance of the patients he operates on and is not very careful during procedures. His obsession with faces leads Crocker to despise folks with unattractive looks, such as the barman Earl Sterling, who worked for Vadim Bobrov at the Dugout Inn.
Sterling sought reconstructive surgery from the doctor so that he could ""get the girls."" Apparently he was not satisfied with his personal appearance, because it was mainly why the barkeep had trouble interacting with members of the opposite sex. Fueled by his obsession, Doc Crocker went mad and accidentally killed and mutilated Earl during his appointment. The doctor felt guilty about what he did to the bartender and went through with trying to bury all evidence of his patient's murder to maintain his innocence, but eventually Earl's employer Vadim realized that his friend had disappeared and filed a missing person report with the security office.
Lamenting over the impacts of his actions, Crocker is unable to fully cope with the fact that he has committed murder, but continues to provide his services as a plastic surgeon. He will become suicidal when confronted by the authorities about the fate of Sterling, due to his inability to handle the psychological stresses of answering for his crimes.
Doctor Sun will take over the responsibility of facial surgery after the completion of The Disappearing Act.

Because she has worked with Nick for years, Ellie has seen Valentine's partners come and go. One such partner was Marty Bullfinch, whom Ellie did not enjoy the company of.[5][6][7][8] Regarding her relationships with other Diamond City residents, Ellie is also a patient of Doc Crocker, having at one point visited him for a consultation. Crocker wanted to follow up on this consultation over drinks.[9] In a similar vein, she believes Earl Sterling may have, before his disappearance, had a crush on her. She will sardonically comment that she is not surprised he ran off.[10] After learning that Doc Crocker was behind Earl's disappearance, she will joke that she is glad that they never followed up on said consultation.[11] Myrna distrusts Ellie, believing her to be a synth and claiming that it is ""obvious"" she is not human[12] (though Myrna's suspicions are completely unfounded).[13]
After Nick decided to investigate the supposed kidnapping of Darla by Skinny Malone's Triggermen, he became imprisoned in Vault 114.[14] Ellie had warned Nick that the rumors of the Triggermen occupying the Vault were most likely a trap, but Nick, in his usual fashion, just smiled and walked out of the door.[15] Nick has since been declared missing, and Ellie is heartbroken that her employer and close friend is gone, and possibly deceased. She is frustrated with herself that she does not have the combat abilities to ""charge across the Commonwealth"" and rescue Nick herself without ending up dead.[16] Upon the Sole Survivor's arrival in Diamond City, Ellie is packing up Nick's belongings from the office, assuming the worst and preparing to close the agency for good.[17][18]
Once the Sole Survivor brings Nick back home safely, Ellie will express gratefulness towards the Sole Survivor and excitement that Nick has returned, as well as thankfulness that her job has been saved.[19] From this point on, Ellie will assist the Sole Survivor and Nick into their investigation of Conrad Kellogg and Shaun's kidnapping, providing feedback during the interview with the Sole Survivor. She will also direct the two of them to Kellogg's house in the abandoned West Stands of Diamond City.[20]
Ellie is a gentle and kind person[4][21] who truly cares for Nick.[22] Nick, similarly, cares for Ellie and appreciates her hard work,[23] though this concern for Ellie goes to the point of withholding some details from her, so as to not worry her.[24] Ellie's concern for Nick's well-being usually stems from his frequently non-chalant reaction to warnings of danger, usually given to him by Ellie.[25][26] However, she shares Nick's unique sense of humor, leading to banter between the two of them around the office.[19][27][2] She has thought about Nick's status as a synth before, but it has never truly bothered her, and the thought never enters her mind anymore.[28]

Through a spy she planted within the raider gang in the Massachusetts State House, Bobbi managed to acquire an accurate map of the Boston underground, created by a city official before the Great War.[3] To recruit diggers for her project, the Big Dig, and further her vendetta against Hancock, Bobbi passes it off as a scheme to get revenge on Mayor McDonough for banishing her kind from Diamond City.

/wiki/John_Hancock,"John Hancock (born John McDonough) is a ghoul living in Goodneighbor in 2287, serving as the settlement's mayor in Fallout. Should the Sole Survivor aid Bobbi No-Nose in a plot to rob him, he will be impressed and humbled by their actions, taking a leave of absence from his duties to offer his services as a companion.
Born John McDonough, Hancock is the estranged younger brother of Diamond City's Mayor McDonough.[1] The two had a rocky relationship from the beginning; John considered him ""entitled"" and claims that the elder brother would sometimes shove rotten tatoes down the back of his shirt and slap them.[2]
Despite this, he held some degree of brotherly love for his elder sibling - but this all changed in 2282, when the elder McDonough ran for mayor on an anti-ghoul platform, inciting hatred and fear of the city's mutated inhabitants.[3] The relationship between them broke down completely when John confronted him in his office after his inauguration speech, and his brother offered no sign of remorse for the anti-ghoul violence that his campaign had incited, simply gloating that the city was finally his.[4]
John tried to save as many ghouls as he could by relocating them to the town of Goodneighbor, at the time run by the ruthless mob boss Vic. Unfortunately, many of the refugees could not adjust to life in the slum and fled into the ruins of Boston and the surrounding wasteland of the Commonwealth, eventually dying to starvation or violence.[5] Over time, he fell into a rut of depression and drug abuse, even using Jet.[6] He also took an experimental radioactive drug in an attempt to transform himself into a ghoul. The attempt was successful, and he today remarks that both the high and the subsequent transformation were ""so worth it.""[7]
His absolute lowest point came after witnessing the murder of a fellow drifter at the hands of Vic's henchmen. Despite knowing that there was nothing he could have done against the armed goons, John nonetheless considered his lack of intervention cowardly, and in the aftermath felt ""like less than nothing."" In a fit of despair, he went on a particularly intense bender of drug abuse, eventually blacking out completely.[8][9]
When he regained consciousness, John found himself lying on the floor of the Old State House next to a set of clothes that belonged to the founding father John Hancock.[10] He assumed the identity of the historical figure and set out to raise a revolutionary militia to overthrow Vic.[11] Temporarily going sober in preparation, he gathered a crew of drifters and convinced KL-E-0 to loan them some weapons.[12]
They gathered together one night, waiting on the rooftops and inside buildings for Vic's goons to gather. Holding off until their opponents were heavily intoxicated from a night of partying, the militia burst from their hiding spots and massacred the gangsters.[13] His muscle wiped out to a man, it was a simple matter for Hancock and his men to storm Vic's quarters in the State House, dragging him out to be hanged by the neck from the balcony.[14]
Looking down from the balcony and seeing that most of the town had gathered to witness the commotion, Hancock issued a simple proclamation: ""Of the people, for the people!"" With that, he was no longer John McDonough, the Diamond City refugee, but John Hancock, the undisputed mayor of Goodneighbor.[15]
By 2287, Hancock continues to serve as mayor. The majority of Goodneighbor's citizens look to him for leadership, and he acts as a source of reassurance concerning the looming synth threat. Following the events of Bobbi No-Nose's big plan (The Big Dig), a plot to steal from his stronghold, he claims to feel too pampered and comfortable.[16] He gives a speech proclaiming his leave of absence. (""No one in power should be comfortable for too long."") Hancock then proceeds to offer his services to the Sole Survivor as a possible companion.
Hancock can be found randomly when taking a card from the loot deck. While Hancock is the active companion, the player character can exhaust him to move one enemy to their space and fight it. If the player character fails to kill that enemy, he must be discarded.

/wiki/Marowski,"Marowski is a major chem supplier in the Commonwealth, living in Goodneighbor in 2287. He can be found inside the Hotel Rexford, accompanied by his bodyguard, Stan Slavin.
Marowski was once a powerful drug kingpin and crime boss who controlled most of the drug trade in the Commonwealth, powerful enough to have ruled Goodneighbor. However, in 2267, a massive heist on Marowski's chem stash in Quincy took place. Marowski put up a huge bounty on the perpetrators of the heist, but was unable to find out who they were.[1] Meanwhile, the heist ruined him financially, forcing him to strike a deal with his new competitor Bobbi No-Nose and downsize his drug business until it was but a fraction of its former size. Marowski never found out who carried out the heist, and on top of that, he is forced to pay a cut of his profits to Bobbi for the deal he made with her. He spends his days running the remains of his drug empire from Hotel Rexford, which he owns. He would like nothing more than to pay back his robbers for what they did to him.[2]
Even though his current influence is no longer what it is used to be, Marowski is still a primary supplier of chems in the region and has a wide network of connections. The dealer maintains a hidden chem lab southeast of Goodneighbor, in the Four Leaf fishpacking plant, protected by a complex security system.[3] Marowski also has a number of loyal associates still working for him, most of whom are also responsible for looking after the Hotel Rexford. This includes his bodyguard Stan as well as Clair Hutchins and Fred Allen, who manage and sell chems at the hotel. Trish, another of Marowski's associates, was the brains behind his lab and acts as his contact in an ongoing business relationship: Marowski provides chems via Trish which are sold to Henry Cooke and Nelson Latimer, who then smuggle the chems into Diamond City and sell them for cheap, making a profit by avoiding Mayor McDonough's tax on chem imports.[4] Latimer regularly meets up with Trish to conduct chem deals for her boss.[5] Marowski has another more clandestine connection: he is an informant on runaway synths for the Institute's Synth Retention Bureau.[6]

The Vault-Tec rep began working as a salesman for Vault-Tec twenty years prior to 2077.[1] He was responsible for going door-to-door, assisting with finalizing paperwork for families pre-selected for entrance to their local Vault. For his work, the rep was to be rewarded a pack of steak knives. Once a month, he had his van serviced at the Red Rocket truck stop near Concord; the employees apparently found him irritating, describing him as an ""uppity asshole"" in their service logs.[2]
The rep was doing his rounds in the neighborhood of Sanctuary Hills in the final hours prior to the Great War when he visited the Sole Survivor's family, having attempted to speak with them several times before. Upon being greeted at the door, he informed them that due to Nate's service in the US Army, they had been selected for entry into Vault 111.
When the air-raid sirens went off, signaling that nuclear strikes from China were imminent, the rep approached the officer guarding the gate, attempting to force his way into the Vault his employer had constructed.

As he fled the scene, the salesman angrily informed the guards that he would report the incident.

/wiki/Kent_Connolly,"Kent Connolly is a ghoulified radio technician, operating out of his studio in the Memory Den in Goodneighbor, in 2287. He is responsible for the maintenance and operation of Silver Shroud Radio, the pride and joy of his childhood.
Connolly was a die-hard fan of both the Silver Shroud and the Mistress of Mystery, having listened to all 420 episodes (holiday special included) of The Silver Shroud and having an encyclopedic knowledge of every detail.[1] His knowledge was even tapped by Frederick Rivers, husband of the Mistress' actor Shannon Rivers, for building and recreating the Order of Mysteries' underground lair and related paraphernalia. Through 2077,[2] Kent and Frederick (by the name Fred) corresponded via holotape through the mail,[3] with Kent providing feedback on various designs Fred had made for the Mistress' equipment, in line with his knowledge of the Hubris Comics continuity. For instance, Kent reviewed Fred's plan for the Mistress' lair and praised the accuracy of the Hall of Trials.[4] He also made various recommendations for the designs of the Phantom Device,[5] Veil of Secrets (adding built-in gas filtration),[6] Garb of Mysteries (using ballistic weave for protection),[7][8][9] and Voice of Set.[10]
Kent also took these opportunities to voice his own opinions for the franchise. He was annoyed by Hubris Comics' continued retcons of the Voice of Set's mechanisms[10] and was disappointed by Fred's decision to model the Garb of Mysteries after the newer, shorter dress rather than the Mistress' traditional dress, planning to organize a letter-writing campaign to Hubris Comics protesting the change.[8] He even wrote directly to Shannon Rivers regarding a series lore inconsistency and hoping to enlist her support for his letter campaign.[11] Kent was unaware of Fred's actual identity, simply assuming he was an equally-dedicated Hubris Comics fan. As such, Kent did not believe that Fred could have actually made a real-life version of the Mistress of Mystery's lair, assuming he had simply made some sort of high-detail model.[3] However, Kent did recognize that Fred had many ""connections,"" and asked if he could also receive some ballistic weave from Fred if the latter managed to get his hands on any.[9]
Connolly's life in the wasteland was a traumatizing time for him. Even in 2287, the memories are still very painful for him to think about, and he avoids the pain the only way he knows: by reliving his memories from before the Great War.[12] Connolly just keeps to himself, reliving his beloved radio serial over and over again in a quiet corner in the Memory Den keeping the pods operational in exchange for time on the memory loungers.[13][14] Through his station, he plays several recordings of various episodes of the old superhero crime-drama that had survived the atomic fire of the Great War intact. During his off time, from his one-room studio, Connolly works tirelessly every day to return the radio show of his hero and role model back to the airwaves for the entire Commonwealth to hear, though the radio signal so far only broadcasts in Goodneighbor and the surrounding Financial District.
However, deep in his heart, Kent ultimately desires to bring justice and peace to Goodneighbor (and by extension the Commonwealth) by bringing about the return of the Silver Shroud, despite realistically knowing how little hope he has for it. Although he made a fully functional replica of the Shroud's signature silver machine gun,[15] the old, rickety ghoul could not just go around shooting people or he would be just another gun-toting hooligan among many.[16] He also has neither the costume, the physical condition, nor the aptitude to take up the mantle of the Silver Shroud, but gladly offers the Sole Survivor the chance to do so in his stead.[17]
Although he doesn't really talk about it in Fallout, as revealed in Fallout 76, Kent was once a very extroverted man, eager to share his comics passion with those he thought would appreciate it, like Frederick Rivers. Suffice to say, with the fiery destruction of the world and society's collapse, he doesn't meet many people with the same passions anymore.
By 2287, Kent Connolly's only real friend in Goodneighbor is Irma, proprietor of the Memory Den where he lives and works. Having known Connolly long enough to be old friends, Irma is supportive of his Silver Shroud obsession and allows him extra time on the memory loungers when she can. However, knowing that he dreamed of taking the Silver Shroud from radio to real-life was too much for Irma who insisted he not pursue it in fear of him getting hurt.[18]

In his adulthood, he became a gun-for-hire, and by 2287, he operates out of Goodneighbor in the Commonwealth. Out of work due to the Gunners scaring off clients, he offers the Sole Survivor his services as a companion for a price.
Born in the Capital Wasteland[1] to parents he never knew,[2] MacCready became the head of the Little Lamplight children's colony in 2274, when he was only ten years old.[3] After Princess declared herself the new Mayor and renamed the position after herself, her rule lasted about five minutes, until MacCready punched her in the face and stated that Little Lamplight needed a leader, not a princess.[3] MacCready's coup resulted in him becoming mayor.[4][Non-game 1]
According to MacCready, engaging targets at long range meant one did not take too many chances in the treacherous Capital Wasteland to stave off death for another day.[5]
When MacCready turned sixteen and left Little Lamplight, he took to wandering the wastelands as a gun for hire. In the course of his travels, he met a woman named Lucy, and the two fell in love. Lucy always had MacCready's back and helped him through the darkest of nights in the wasteland. With her at his side, he could press ahead no matter the horrors that faced him.[6][7] He told her that he was a soldier, out of fear that he might lose her if he revealed that he was a stone-cold killer. She never learned the truth.[8] She gave him a carved toy soldier in return, something he always kept on himself regardless of where he went.[9]
Lucy and MacCready had a son, Duncan, but Lucy was killed by feral ghouls.[10][11] He made a promise to Duncan to clean up his act and be a better person, starting with swearing off cursing.[12] He settled down and built a homestead. Everything was peaceful for a time as MacCready worked the land and Duncan grew. His almost idyllic life came to an end when his son was exposed to something in their fields and the next day developed a fever accompanied by blue boils all over his body. The disease sapped his strength, and by the time MacCready decided to hit the road and find a cure, Duncan was almost too weak to walk. He entrusted his child to the care of his friends and departed.[13] Every doctor he talked to had never heard of the disease and was at a loss as to how to help the child.[14]
MacCready moved to the Commonwealth searching for a cure. When he arrived, the Gunners were recruiting sharpshooters into their ranks and MacCready joined up to amass money for his ultimate goal. Though the caps were plentiful, the Gunners' lack of scruples and indiscriminate approach to collateral damage were at odds with MacCready's personal code and the promise he made to his son.[15] MacCready broke ties with them in the summer of 2287 and resumed his career as a freelance contractor.[16]
Shortly after ditching the Gunners, MacCready met Sinclair, a man who was looking for the same thing: a cure for the mysterious blue boils, which were afflicting his partner. Sinclair found information that indicated Med-Tek Laboratories was experimenting with a universal cure at its Medford facility, but he never got the chance to act on the information because his partner had already died, causing him to give up the search.[17] Meanwhile, MacCready, given the Med-Tek facility's security codes by Sinclair in solidarity, attempted to breach the facility on his own. He only made it a short way in before an infestation of feral ghouls pushed him back.[18] MacCready however kept the codes in case he ever found someone he could trust who would help him get through the facility's defenses and the hordes of feral ghouls.[19][20]
To make a living in the meantime, he set up shop in Goodneighbor, unwilling to tangle with Diamond City's security force or wander the wastes alone. Hancock let him keep a room in the VIP section of The Third Rail, so MacCready started searching for clients. However, his troubles with the Gunners were far from over. Two mercs in particular, Winlock and Barnes were not willing to let a deserter operate in their territory. For three months, they hounded MacCready and drove off his customers. Add to the fact that nobody was willing to work with a former Gunner, no matter how talented or soft-spoken.[21] One of the few people willing to overlook his former affiliation was Daisy, the ghoul proprietor of the general store in Goodneighbor. MacCready helped her manage unfriendly customers on repeated occasions and the two became fast friends.[18]
However, his former associates never let up. Around October in 2287, they confronted MacCready at the Third Rail, demanding that he cease doing business in their territory or suffer the consequences.[22] leaving MacCready in a bind: if he tried to pay them off, they would more than likely take the caps and kill him with the small army of Gunners they had at their disposal. If he ran, there was no guarantee they would relent until they'd chased him entirely out of the Commonwealth. Conversely, on his own, he had no actual chance of wiping them out to send a message to the rest of the Gunners to back away. It is here that he potentially can meet the Sole Survivor and offer his services.[23] Once he's worked with them long enough, MacCready confides his plan to take out his two aggressors and in a way that both won't be traced back to him as well as make enough of a dent in the Gunner bottom line to force them to stop coming after him.  Afterward, he pays them back the money he was hired with but chooses to continue being a companion to his ex-employer as thanks for helping him sort out his problem.[24]
Though notoriously foul-mouthed and belligerent in his younger years, the 22-year-old MacCready is far more reserved and polite. Years of hard living turned him into a hardened warfighter, coping with adversity through liberal use of sarcasm and humor. However, he is not totally immune, as pre-War atrocities can inspire anger from him[25] and he is not a fan of people from before the Great War, on account of them bringing the nuclear holocaust down on Earth.[26]
MacCready isn't averse to violence but doesn't revel in it either. If possible, he will bluff his way through to minimize danger to himself and others.[27] The latter includes eating fish, which tends to make him less-than-pleasant company.[28]
On a more personal side, MacCready misses a lot of features of living in the Capital Wasteland, including Galaxy News Radio with Three Dog[29] and the monuments of downtown D.C.[30] He also collects old Grognak the Barbarian comic books, picking through the ruins in search of issues to complete his collection.[31] As of 2287, the collection is almost complete, only missing the issue where Mastadonald and Skullpocalypse teamed up to fight Grognak.[32]

/wiki/Lorenzo_Cabot,"Lorenzo Cabot is the patriarch of the Cabot family, imprisoned in the basement of Parsons State Insane Asylum in the Commonwealth in 2287.
Lorenzo was born on March 28, 1835.[1] He is married to Wilhelmina Cabot and they together have two children, Jack and Emogene. Lorenzo was a talented archaeologist with an interest in ancient civilizations, and was known for his theories on the existence of precursor civilizations which came before the earliest traces of humanity. His theories were scorned by the rest of the field as well as his own son, and Lorenzo's characteristic temper towards his detractors also did not earn him any favors.[2][3]
In 1894, Lorenzo and his partner Metternich undertook a secret expedition to the Rub' al Khali desert in the Middle East, seeking to uncover the lost city of Ubar and prove Lorenzo's theories. Their work paid off by May, leading to the discovery of a subterranean structure holding non-human remains and artifacts. Among these artifacts was a mysterious crown, which became the only item Lorenzo took from the site. He soon began wearing the crown and gained vast knowledge regarding the ancient civilization. Believing that there was much more to discover in the city, and intending to ""teach"" his family of his findings, Lorenzo had the site buried (against his partner's wishes) to protect its existence until he could return with his family to uncover its remaining secrets.[4]
Lorenzo returned to Boston a changed man, both physically and mentally. The artifact he wore greatly boosted his physical condition, halting his aging, increasing his strength, and even giving him psychic abilities such as telekinesis. It also could no longer be removed from him without causing great physical damage.[5][6] Furthermore, Lorenzo became increasingly psychotic, paranoid, and violent, posing a risk to everyone around him; his personality became unrecognizable to the rest of his family.[7][8] He proceeded to commit numerous crimes which would have landed him the death penalty had it not being for his family's influence. In July 1898, the family confined Lorenzo in the basement of Parsons State Insane Asylum to stop him from committing further harm.[6][9][10]
Lorenzo has remained in confinement since then while his son Jack studies the artifact, ostensibly in hopes of curing his father. An early development in Jack's research was the discovery of certain compounds in Lorenzo's blood; from these, Jack derived a serum which could halt aging. Using this serum, Lorenzo's family has been able to survive long past their natural lifespans, just like Lorenzo himself.[6] Lorenzo himself despises his family for their perceived betrayal and would like nothing more than to gain his freedom and take revenge on them.[9] He has otherwise spent the following four centuries contained underneath Parsons State. Even two centuries after the Great War, he is guarded by a network of mercenaries hired by the family, and his existence remains their greatest secret.
Trapped underneath Parsons, Lorenzo's abilities have been largely limited to his containment enclosure. As a result, most of his time has been spent ""exploring [his] own mind,"" supposedly using the artifact to commune with the precursor civilization and gain their knowledge.[11][12] Under his new worldview, he has come to see human regulations and ethics as hindrances to his research. For him, the lawless wasteland is a perfect opportunity to pursue his interests with nothing capable of getting in his way -- a fact that his son is all too aware of.[10][13] Unbeknownst to his family, Lorenzo is working towards his escape, using his psychic influence to persuade a group of raiders to carry out his plans.
The Secret of Cabot House: After killing Lefty and the raiders attacking Parsons State, Lorenzo will tell the Sole Survivor to release him, while Jack will tell them to kill Lorenzo in his cell.
After finishing The Secret of Cabot House by siding with Lorenzo, one may run into him at one of several random encounter locations. He examines some dead ghoul settlers and tells the player character that he killed them to study their condition.

Lieutenant Clint is later one of the local Gunner leaders at Quincy ruins. In return for leaving and betraying the Minutemen in what became the Quincy Massacre, he was given the rank of lieutenant with the Gunners. A handful of settlers and Minutemen led by Preston Garvey managed to escape so he sent a detachment of Gunners in pursuit. He ordered Ezra Hollis to be captured alive and he killed him personally to gain his new troops' trust.[2]

/wiki/Deacon,"Deacon (real name unknown)[1] is an enigmatic agent of the Railroad in 2287. After the Sole Survivor begins traveling the Commonwealth, he scouts them as a potential recruit, speaking in favor of their admittance after they locate the organization. Should they agree to join, he will offer them his services as a companion.
Little is known about his past prior to joining the Railroad, which he admits he is dishonest about.[2] Among other things, he claims that he was among the first liberated Gen 3s, that he helped found the Railroad, and that he is the true leader of the organization while Desdemona merely serves as a figurehead.[3] Privately, Desdemona suspects that he and the mysterious ""John D."" credited in the Railroad's records with pioneering many of the organization's current practices are one and the same.[4]
The most detailed account of his past that he shares holds that when he was younger, he was a member of the University Point (UP) Deathclaws, a gang that harassed people accused of being synths. The gang's antagonism eventually escalated to the point of lynching of a man suspected of being a Gen 3, an act that left Deacon shaken.[5] Unwilling to continue down such a violent path, Deacon left the gang to settle down as a farmer, eventually marrying a woman named Barbara. They intended to start a family, but the UP Deathclaws reemerged and attacked the farm. The gang had somehow learned, to both Deacon's and Barbara's surprise, that Barbara was a synth.[6] Barbara was killed in the attack, and Deacon slaughtered the gang in retaliation. 
In the aftermath, he was contacted by the Railroad, who were unaware of his prior affiliation with the gang. Despite believing himself undeserving, Deacon swore himself to their cause.[7] Though there is no direct evidence that this story is any more honest than his other claims, he insists when pressed that it is the truth.[8]
By 2273, he had taken the name ""Deacon,"" and in December of that year survived an Institute raid on the Railroad, with Pinky Thompson attributing the organization's survival to his escape plan.[9] When Pinky stepped down in 2277, Deacon aided Doctor Carrington and Desdemona in revising the organization's policies to put a focus on operational security.[10] Deacon subsequently became one of Desdemona's top men, carrying out important missions and escorting synths of high value for the Railroad.[citation needed]
By 2287, most of his work consists of gathering intel on persons of interest.[11] When the Sole Survivor awakens from cryostasis inside Vault 111 and emerges into the area, Deacon takes an interest in the traveler. He shadows them throughout the Commonwealth in order to gather information on their activities, with the hopes of recruiting them for the organization in a time of crisis.[12]",Deacon,Deacon,Deacon,NPCMDeacon,Human,Male,,330102,285385,YetAnotherModder,100.0,00045AC9,00045AC9,50976,NPCMDeacon,NPCMDeacon,CompanionDeaconDeaconAtDiamondCity (Diamond City security),CompanionDeacon,
/wiki/Desdemona,"Desdemona, also known by her nickname Dez, is the leader of the secretive underground movement known as the Railroad in the Commonwealth in 2287. Believing synths to be sentient beings who deserve freedom and respect, the Railroad's mission is to help them flee the Institute, as well as protect them from the Brotherhood of Steel.
Desdemona first signed up with and joined the Railroad sometime before September 2276, serving under Pinky Thompson.[2] Desdemona was voted into the Alpha position following the resignation of Thompson around December 2277.
During her tenure, she, along with the assistance of Dr. Stanley Carrington and Deacon, made major changes concerning the organization's operational security, leading to a drastic increase in the number of synths successfully rescued. During her time as the Railroad leader, she devised a system of railsigns and improvements to the dead drops used for communication, and added Tinker Tom, Glory, and Tommy Whispers as members to Railroad HQ. P.A.M. was also discovered at some point during Desdemona's time as the leader.[3]
Previous security breaches have lead to Desdemona being wary of those who manage to follow the Freedom Trail and enter the passcode to access the Railroad HQ.[4][3] Despite this, those who can prove themselves to her will, in time, earn her respect,[5] often to the ire of her second-in-command, Dr. Carrington.[6] As the leader of the Railroad, Desdemona is in charge of day-to-day operations and maintaining contact with the widespread network of safehouses.[3]",Desdemona,Desdemona,Desdemona,NPCFDesdemona,Human,Female,,329965,285393,YetAnotherModder,100.0,00045AD1,00045AD1,000508ED,,NPCFDesdemona,Desdemona,Desdemona,

Doctor Carrington provides health and medical services to the agents of the intelligence organization known as the Railroad.[2] He is also Desdemona's righthand man. However, he relates that this has minimal impact. The doctor is easily exasperated and irritated, though he claims this to be because of the Railroad's numerous setbacks and losses. He sometimes questions Desdemona's tendency to send agents on dangerous missions to gather intelligence when said intel is already more or less known.[3]
Back when the doctor was stationed at the organization's former headquarters, the Switchboard, located in Lexington, he managed to escape when it was stormed by Institute synths.[4] In the confusion of the attack, Carrington left behind a prototype of an unknown device, which one of the Railroad's main field operatives, Deacon was assigned to a mission to recover.[5]

/wiki/Drummer_Boy,"Drummer Boy is the primary courier and liaison for the Railroad in 2287. 
Not much is known about Drummer Boy. When speaking of himself, he expresses himself as a punctual person with great attention to detail. His role in the mysterious intelligence community known as the Railroad lands him the responsibility of being the liaison between agents and is in charge of the dead drop system organized by Desdemona. The system is the primary method used by the organization's network of safehouses to keep in contact and coordinate the extraction of fugitive gen 3 synths from the Commonwealth. While this method is slow and creates much legwork for Dez's runners, it provides an extra layer of security to the Railroad's work. For those reasons, Drummer Boy is often bored with his current job, wishing that he would switch places with a heavy like Glory and conduct field ops. Yet Drummer Boy is comfortable with where he stands due to his vitality to the organization's motives in the area.

/wiki/Glory,"Glory, originally G7-81,[1] is a synth member of the Railroad in 2287. She is a ""heavy"" for the Railroad, sent on their most dangerous and combat-heavy missions.[2] Despite this, she prefers not to engage in assignments where she must kill synths, even Generation 1 or 2 models.[3]
Glory was created by the Institute and known as G7-81. She was only allowed to see a few rooms, such as her barracks and workplace. She had two known roles: to assist Synth Development in creating more synths, as well as scour the surface to find worthwhile materials and salvage. While she did not think the scientists were mean, she still began to resent them because they treated her like a mere robot and tool.
In 2280, she was one of many synths rescued by the Railroad. Unlike most rescued synths, she opted to join the Railroad and actively fight for her fellow synths' freedom. She initially worked with High Rise at Ticonderoga, but was eventually called into the Railroad HQ and promoted to a heavy agent in the same year.[1] She took Tommy Whispers under her wing in 2281 and trained him into becoming a heavy agent.[4]
If spoken to during the initial meeting with the Railroad leaders after Emergent Behavior has been completed, she will mention that G5-19 - the brain-dead synth whose body is now Curie's - was like family to her and that she should have refused to allow her body to be donated to Curie. She can be persuaded that Curie's scientific skills will be a big help, though she does not seem particularly convinced.[5]
Unlike some of the other members of the Railroad, Glory feels that even the primitive Generation 1 synths deserve to be freed from Institute control. She shares her opinion on this matter with the Sole Survivor during the mission Memory Interrupted, when she's forced to fight against several Generation 1 synths.[3]",Glory,Glory,Glory,NPCFGlory,Synth,Female,,329966,285391,YetAnotherModder,100.0,00045ACF,00045ACF,000508EE,,NPCFGlory,Glory,Glory,

/wiki/Predictive_Analytic_Machine,"The P.A.M. (Predictive Analytic Machine) is a sophisticated AI tied to a modified Assaultron unit, currently installed at the Railroad HQ in 2287.
The development of the Predictive Analytic Machine, abbreviated P.A.M., was green-lit in 2067, commissioned under the P.A.M. Initiative. This was a joint project between the Defense Intelligence Agency and the military to develop an advanced artificial intelligence program capable of accurately predicting the future, based on data fed into her systems by her human operators. In reality, the primary motive of the people working on P.A.M. was to develop her for foreseeing and stopping a nuclear war before it ever happened. She was eventually wired to a modified Assaultron body, granting her increased mobility. This made it easier for P.A.M. to be dismantled and relocated in the event of an enemy attack.[2]
Although the project had suffered numerous setbacks and other misfortunes during the duration of its course, P.A.M. ultimately succeeded in her main goal, managing to correctly predict that nuclear warheads directed towards the United States would soon be deployed. With this information at hand, the military was able to mobilize its fleet of ballistic missiles and raise the DEFCON status to the highest level in preparation for an upcoming invasion.[3] Although the Great War only lasted two hours, the nuclear exchange had silenced the majority of the larger pockets of human civilization across the globe. Due to its isolated location, the Switchboard never took a direct hit, sparing P.A.M. from the wrath of atomic fire. With her human operators now deceased, the computer's systems went into hibernation, leaving her in a dormant state for over 200 years.
It was only when the Switchboard was discovered by Railroad operatives that P.A.M. would sense the presence of another human after over two centuries of inactivity. The organization's technological experts were able to reprogram the computer to support their cause. P.A.M. would soon prove herself to be an important asset to the success of the Railroad's cause in the Commonwealth.
When the Railroad contingent stationed at the Switchboard was raided by enemy Institute synths led by coursers, having secretly been under the observation of their spies, the survivors of the attack managed to save P.A.M. from being claimed by the Institute. She was recovered from the Switchboard and relocated to the catacombs below the Old North Church fully intact, in part due to her robotic frame. P.A.M.'s advanced mathematical capabilities, processing power and large databases of information about the region ensure that operations are carried out efficiently with little to no chance of failure and that the Railroad remains protected from deadly destruction and annihilation at the hands of the Institute. Because the human race is an extremely complex set of variables, P.A.M. constantly requires herself to revise her algorithms in order to ensure accurate prediction models, especially when wild cards like the Sole Survivor come into play.
Upon collecting her for the Brotherhood, she can be found in Proctor Quinlan's room.

Tinker Tom is the engineer, inventor, weapons expert and the holder of the third-highest position of leadership in the Railroad. As the quartermaster of the organization, he is in charge of maintaining equipment for agents as well as researching new weapons and gadgets for them to use in their operations in the field. Tom joined the Railroad under the leadership of Desdemona in 2279 after an Institute grenade wiped out his family farm.[2] Given his intellect, he was assigned to the HQ and became an essential member of the team; by 2280, he became absolutely indispensable to the Railroad's operations, despite his growing eccentricity.[3]
As time passed, he developed severe psychological problems, suspected to be caused by the extreme stress he was under, also beginning to develop chem addictions.[4] When the DIA facility, named ""Switchboard,"" was discovered in 2281, Tom was reassigned to it. It was there he discovered P.A.M. During his time there, Tom also restored an Old World cutting edge handgun for use by newly-promoted heavy agent, Tommy Whispers.[5]
In 2283, an Institute informant ""Patriot"" began attempting to communicate with the outside world. Tom was assigned the task of decrypting the encoded holotapes that were being sent out with escaped synths. Initially unsuccessful, Tom eventually made a breakthrough in 2284 when the coded message was simply two words, ""Mass Fusion."" He is brilliant and energetic, but also paranoid and constantly fabricates conspiracy theories about the Institute, its synths and their machinations around the Commonwealth.[6]
He is also the only known individual in the Commonwealth who can decode a courser chip, a requirement for entering the Institute.
He has some skill with constructing and improving weaponry, as he had worked on what would become the railway rifle,[7] a Railroad hunting rifle and the Deliverer pistol, among various other weapons Railroad agents utilize.

He can be recruited as a companion upon reaching a trigger point in Concord during the quest Out of Time and returning to him.
Codsworth is a Mister Handy robotic butler for the Sole Survivor's family before the Great War. He was bought by the family not long before October 23, 2077, as evidenced by the Mr. Handy box in the laundry room of the Sole Survivor's home. He was not granted entry to Vault 111, as claimed by the Vault-Tec rep,[1] and was left behind when the war was announced on television. Codsworth is reunited with the Survivor after 210 years of roaming around Sanctuary Hills, still loyal to his owner.[2]
At first, Codsworth seems cheerful and oblivious to what has happened. During the first ten years after the war, Codsworth tried to keep himself busy by doing futile housekeeping work, such as keeping the nuclear fallout-tainted floors waxed, dusting a collapsed house, and polishing a rusted car. However, talking to him further reveals that he is actually very depressed about the state of the world, and was deeply affected by his two-centuries-long isolation. To cope, he pretended that nothing happened.[3] At some point after the bombs fell, Codsworth visited the town of Concord‚Äîmentioning that the locals only ""pummeled [him] with sticks a few times"" and ""shot at [him] on a few occasions"" before he retreated to Sanctuary.[4][5]

/wiki/Shaun,"Shaun, also known as Father, is the son of the Sole Survivor and is the director of the Institute in 2287. He serves as the primary antagonist of Fallout for three of the game's four endings.
Shaun was less than a year old by October 2077.[4] On October 23, during the outbreak of the Great War, his parents took him and fled to nearby Vault 111 as the atomic bombs began to fall on the Commonwealth. Unaware of the true purpose of the Vault, Shaun and his parents became frozen in cryogenic suspension. Approximately six months following their internment, a revolt occurred and the staff abandoned Vault 111, leaving behind those frozen within, completely unaware of what had occurred.
The cryogenically preserved Vault participants remained undisturbed for around 150 years until the Institute discovered records regarding Vault 111. At this time, the Institute was desperate for genetic material unaffected by the radiation-ravaged wasteland for their Third Generation Synth project. The infant, Shaun, represented the perfect source of uncorrupted DNA, and the Institute set about to acquire him.
Sometime in 2227, the Institute dispatched their mercenary, Conrad Kellogg, to Vault 111 to retrieve Shaun. Along with two Institute technicians, Kellogg revived Shaun and his parents. The parent holding Shaun was unwilling to part with their son and resisted Kellogg, and was shot and killed. Kellogg then returned the other parent to cryogenic suspension and terminated the life support of the other frozen Vault participants.
Shaun was then raised by the Institute as one of their own, later nicknamed ""Father"" for his role in providing the DNA required to complete the third generation synths. In time, he became the acting director of the Institute. After his promotion, he learned the truth that one of his parents was still alive.
His feelings about the Institute as the future and last hope of humanity are based upon the beliefs he was instilled under their control; he possesses a fear of the surface, having never visited it himself since he was an infant, and he is concerned of the potential threats of the Commonwealth to the Institute.[5] Ultimately, Shaun wishes to take humanity further underground and away from the radiation, mutant, and danger-infested surface world.[6] Shaun does not require the rest of the Institute to adhere to his personal beliefs. In contrast to his contempt towards people above, he is not only open to recruitment of talented individuals, but allows them to gain high positions, like with Madison Li.
Shaun‚Äôs surviving parent, who later becomes known as the Sole Survivor of Vault 111, would later escape the Vault in 2287. Unknown to the Sole Survivor upon their awakening, it was Shaun's personal choice to awaken the Sole Survivor from cryostasis, not an error of Vault 111. Shaun considered the Sole Survivor's awakening to be an ""experiment"" of sorts, wishing to see whether or not their parent would care about him enough to seek him out. Shaun has a very aggressive form of cancer and one of the endings is for the Sole Survivor to take Shaun's place as director of the Institute upon his death, which was his primary wish all along. 
After building a teleporter to infiltrate the Institute, the Sole Survivor finds Shaun, shocked to discover he is an elderly man and not the boy they envisioned. Meanwhile, Shaun struggles somewhat with being reunited with the Sole Survivor in the Institute, ironically seeing one of his parents 'younger' than himself and wondering what they could have shared if the circumstances had been different.
The Sole Survivor can choose whether or not to side with him. Shaun is convinced that the Institute is the only hope for humanity and tries to subtly convince the Sole Survivor of this. He gives them nearly unlimited access to the Institute, introduces them to the personnel of the Institute and even trusts them with missions to seek out and retrieve rogue synths.
He also does not seem to mind if his parent disagrees with his stances as long as they don't endanger the Institute, and continues supporting them as their heir for as long as they are loyal to the Institute. Should the Sole Survivor, during the quest Nuclear Family, tell them that they don't believe that they can take his place, Shaun encourages them to create their own place rather than follow in his footsteps.[7]
Having been raised in and by the Institute rather than by his parents, Shaun mostly lacks compassion, though he has a strong desire for humanity to survive and believes he is doing what he must to protect humanity from extinction. Although he puts on a well-mannered attitude when reuniting with his parent, if the Sole Survivor keeps doing quests for Shaun, it soon becomes evident that Shaun has the capacity for being quite homicidal and violent to those who wish to get in the Institute's ways, particularly when he orders the deaths of two other factions. If the Sole Survivor refuses to kill the Railroad, Shaun then changes it to an order instead of a request, claiming it ""needs"" to be done. Shaun never uses ""kill"" or ""slaughter"" when he insists the Railroad and the Brotherhood of Steel be taken out, using language like ""destroy"" and ""eliminate"" instead. Shaun only uses ""kill"" regarding the possibility of the Institute being killed.
As he has never explored the surface himself beyond infancy, as well as being raised to become a leader who dishes out orders, Shaun is used to ordering others to do his requests indirectly for him, such as using synths as his lapdogs. Shaun is never shown expressing a desire to talk things out with Desdemona or Arthur Maxson peacefully. Another example of his observant nature is his desire for the Institute to remain in secrecy, as well as him condoning his organization abducting people for the Institute's research. Shaun and the Institute are also unable to solve the issue of runaway synths to the degree the Institute requires an entire bureau to retrieving them; rather than solving the issue first, Shaun instead tells his parent to go murder the other factions. This shows Shaun's priorities, his very cynical attitude towards other people, as well as his reluctance to compromise. His view that humanity should remain underground for its protection is similar to that of the Vault-Tec Corporation, as well as Alphonse Almodovar.
His impersonal attitude towards murder is also shown by him freeing his parent, but also potentially allowing his parent to be killed by the various dangers in the wasteland. However, it is suggested that Shaun wanted to test his parent as an example of humanity, and to have faith restored in human nature as well as the parent he never knew. The Sole Survivor may try to challenge their son's beliefs, though it is impossible for Shaun to fully come around regarding his attitudes towards the people of the Commonwealth, partially due to some of the limited dialogue options of Fallout. If the Sole Survivor tells Shaun that life on the surface is not that horrible and people manage anyway, Shaun replies, ""Perhaps, but at costs too great to be worth it."" He is idealistic when it comes to his parent and admits to not having given much thought to the possibility of the Sole Survivor wishing not to represent the Institute.[8]
Shaun does not believe that synths are truly ""sentient"" and views them as tools, finding the idea of sentient synths to be ludicrous.[9] As such, he views the Railroad as an illogical and ridiculous organization with misguided beliefs. He claims he has dealt with them and seen the lengths they do to complete their objectives and says they refuse to listen to reason, calling them zealots with a bizarre crusade with no regard for human life. If the Sole Survivor reveals they helped the Railroad during the Battle of Bunker Hill, Shaun calls their actions ""so stupid"" and raises his voice, saying synths can not truly feel emotions like fear. Shaun seems to be in denial of synths gaining consciousness similar to humans, even in spite of Alan Binet's evidence.
Shaun seems indifferent upon remembering the death of one of his parents. He refers to the ""incident"" as ""collateral damage"" which potentially angers the Sole Survivor, though Shaun does offer that he has had his whole life to come to terms with that information. While Shaun agrees his parent was killed, he is unsure if it should be called murder. However, despite this indifference, he never lets go of hatred towards his parent's murderer, Conrad Kellogg, whom he does not forgive even if the Sole Survivor does.[10]
He does occasionally show some compassion. For instance, he apologizes to his surviving parent for the Railroad's destruction, which he does even if the Sole Survivor destroys them before Shaun orders it. He also claims he does not take pleasure in their destruction and that he has never been one to advocate violence, but views it as a necessity in their situation. If the Sole Survivor keeps working with the Institute, Shaun does eventually agree to finally address the people of the Commonwealth and engage in public relations with them, though in the style of a recorded message with his parent as the narrator instead of him, another example of Shaun's indirect behavior.
During the Minutemen/Brotherhood of Steel/Railroad endings, when the Sole Survivor can talk to Shaun on his deathbed, he remains convinced to the end that by destroying the Institute they are making a terrible mistake, and is forthcoming in his bitterness at the turn of events. His parent can convince him to grant the access codes to at least partially disable some of the synth defenders fighting the player character's allied forces, assuming they pass the Charisma checks, before he asks them to leave him be as his death is coming regardless of whether or not the Institute detonates. If this ending is taken and the young synth is taken with them, the Sole Survivor will receive a holotape recorded by Father after being interacted with. The synth Shaun tells the Sole Survivor ""I didn't listen to it, so I dunno what it says, but I think it's important"".
It is revealed that the young boy was reprogrammed to believe that the player character is their parent, as the first meeting between the synth and player character (who was led to believe that the synth was their missing son) caused the synth to become confused and call for help. The reason for him being reprogrammed is explained by the real Shaun in the holotape, saying ""I would ask only that you give him a chance. A chance to be a part of whatever future awaits the Commonwealth.""",Father,Shaun,maleboston,NPCMShaun60,Human,Male,,377655,172442,YetAnotherModder,100,0002A19A,0002A19A,0005C337,NPCMShaunBabyNPCMShaun10NPCMShaun60,NPCMShaun60,"shaunShaunBabyVoiceOnly (baby, voice)MQ203MemoryH_Shaun (Shattered)",Shaun,

Atom's Wrath takes its lead directly from Henri, meaning it will remain passive as long as the Sole Survivor does not provoke Henri into resorting to violence. Should the mad cultist be turned hostile in any way, be it by mocking him in dialogue or by other means, Atom's Wrath as well as the nearby machinegun turret will join him in attacking the trespasser. Since said fight will most likely happen in extremely close quarters, the Assaultron usually will not get much of a chance to deploy its devastating eye laser weapon, thus somewhat mitigating its threat potential. Its powerful melee attacks can still pose a minor problem for an unprepared enemy, mostly due to the robot lurking in an alcove from where it will spring a surprise flanking attack if the enemy did not pay enough attention to their surroundings before engaging Henri in dialogue.

/wiki/Swan,"Swan, born Edgar Swann, is a unique super mutant behemoth living in Swan's Pond, the center of the Boston Common in 2287.
He was originally Edgar Swann, a low level Institute worker who found himself on the wrong end of the law after stealing cigarettes. He believed his trial worked out in his favor, offered ""probation"" in the form of living in isolation for a month, provided with food, water, and shelter, only requiring him to write in a journal. Unbeknownst to Swann, he had been infected with FEV and the probation he accepted was a ruse to observe the effects.[1]
By the sixth day, Swann realized something was wrong when the scientists returned for additional tests. His body ached and he felt jittery and agitated. His mind was racing and he felt as if he could hardly write. He knew the scientists had done something to him, but he was not aware of what it was.[2]
Two weeks into the experiment, Swann's condition stabilized and improved by all accounts. He had experienced a threefold increase in muscle mass and a major increase in intellectual capacity. Swann was now privy to the experience in its entirety but was enthusiastic about it, even having applied to the research team, anticipating assisting in his own experiment.[3]
However, Swann found that by the third week of the experiment, his mental faculties were backsliding. He experienced seizures and returned to the observation lab. He understood that his prognosis was poor and learned that the viral strain he was infected with is fundamentally unstable. His health rapidly deteriorated and he knew that the seizures were only the beginning of the side effects he would endure. He anxiously waited to discover his own fate, worrying the scientists would reject him as they had done for so many others.[4]
Swann's fears of being exiled to the Commonwealth were realized and he eventually made his way to Boston Common, an abandoned park in the downtown ruins, where he made his home in the groundskeeper shack. It was here that he finally lost his mind to his mutation,[5] eventually creating armor from the ruined swan boats of the pond, having turned into a super mutant behemoth by 2287.[6] His experiment logs are found scattered around his living area. 
The area in which Swan lives is considered extremely dangerous and wastelanders avoid it at all costs. Makeshift signs warn of his presence as one approaches Boston Common.

Head of the Robotics division of the Institute, Alan Binet was instrumental in creating third generation synths. He is a talented designer, a must in the Institute's meritocratic environment, and believes in a healthy work/life balance and tries to put his work out of his mind when he retires for the day.[1] Binet fully believes that the synths are potentially sentient beings and has had many arguments over it with his friend and colleague, Max Loken. His impassioned speeches about artificial sentience and machines are a constant feature of Robotics, so much that Loken could write them down from memory. Binet is keenly aware that his words fall on deaf ears, as dismissing the synths as machines is what allows the Institute to keep using them as slaves. When reminded of the option to trade the Institute for the wasteland, he is quick to remark that he's only trying to broaden the horizons of his colleagues.[2] In fact, he believes that the synths could be a further evolution of humanity, if the Institute could only allow them to demonstrate their potential. These are not popular ideas in the Institute, especially in light of the recent increase in autonomous behavior among the latest gen-three models.[3]
Beyond simply challenging Institute ideology, his affinity for working with synths is another source of problems. Following the loss of his wife, Alan has been bonding a little too closely with the synthetic replacement he created in her image, ostensibly as an experiment to determine whether synths are sophisticated enough to form social and familial bonds. Eve has, in fact, caused him to come under the suspicion of deviant behavior.[4] Justin Ayo, head of the SRB, believes that his admiration for the synths has led him to mistake them for sentient beings and that Binet helps them escape to the surface. Binet vehemently denies the charge, as he would not do something as cruel as banishing them to the hellish wasteland.[5] The situation is not helped by the fact that the rate of escapes has greatly increased in recent months.[6]

/wiki/Clayton_Holdren,"Doctor Clayton Holdren[1] (username Holdren.C)[2] is a member of the Institute. He is the director of Institute BioScience in 2287.
The head of BioScience, Director Holdren oversees the Institute's research on agriculture, botany, genetics, and medicine, as well as its hydroponic food production.[3] Holdren dedicates himself to furthering the Institute (and Father's) goals. However, he also believes that research does not always need to pursue a utilitarian goal,[4] which has led to his passion project: the Synth Zoological Initiative, a mission to develop synthetic versions of pre-War animals, which he justifies as a way of showing the endless potential of synth technology.[3] Still, the SZI is just that, a passion project, and he knows to put it aside when more important matters are at stake... though he won't hesitate when opportunities for the project and his division arise,[5] and he is currently planning the justification for an aquatic phase of the project.[6]
Personality-wise, Holdren is courteous to all. He takes a teacherly attitude towards his subordinates and always presents himself as polite, if not apologetic, when delivering unfavorable news. He is very self-assured and has great confidence in his division and their research.[7] However, these traits also show him to be somewhat ambitious, and his teacherly attitude can become patronizing, if not mocking. Furthermore, although he genuinely believes that his and the Institute's work will pave humanity's future, he purposefully ignores the suffering of those on the surface (such as the Warwick family), seeing the Commonwealth's people as the ""last remnants of a dying past.""[8]

Although everyone in the Institute is a doctor of some sort, Volkert is the closest that they have to a dedicated physician and medical care specialist.[2] He's responsible for maintaining medical records and ensuring every member of the Institute remains in good shape to advance the cause of science.[3]
He has a gruff bedside manner[4] and has a particularly low opinion of the surface's medical practitioners, considering them little more than butchers.[5] His dedication to his patients' well-being puts him in a strenuous relationship with the rest of the BioScience division, as he spends most of his time (up to sixteen hours a day) practicing medicine and administrating the clinic at the expense of other tasks the department, or his colleagues, assign to him.[6][7][8]
He even has unrestricted access to Hydroponics (for medicinal purposes) and will simply take any plants he needs from the plantations, much to Isaac Karlin's annoyance.[9] Volkert also carries out medical experiments, testing new compounds on synth workers. He does not consider synths humans or even persons, and treats his test subjects with clinical detachment, expecting them to record any symptoms they experience in full detail.[10]
Perhaps the most difficult relationship is with his son, Brendan Volkert. Unlike his father, who can spend endless tiring days delving into theoretical bioscience (antigens and immunogens, thoretical gene and virotherapy treatments, producing oncolytic viruses through genetic modification), Brendan struggles with science and complex theoretical topics. In an effort to impress his father, Brendan feigns interest in his father's biological pursuits. Dean accepts it, hoping that his son will follow in his footsteps one day.[11][12][13] He sincerely hopes this will stop Brendan from disturbing other Institute members from their duties, as he is sick of fielding complaints from Evan Watson of Advanced Systems regarding Brendan's attempts to ingratiate himself with Rosalind Orman, his love interest.[14]",Dean Volkert,vaulttecscientist,maleboston,NPCMDeanVolkert,Human,Male,,400435,386398,YetAnotherModder,84,0005E55E,0005E55E,00061C33,NPCMDeanVolkert,NPCMDeanVolkert,DeanVolkert,DeanVolkert,

Dr. Watson works under Dr. Madison Li as the specialist projects lead scientist of Institute Advanced Systems.[1] He is a strict, no-nonsense man who handles many of the division's administrative tasks, such as maintaining thorough safety regulations, reviewing research proposals for approval, dealing with Facilities to secure power allotments,[4] and generally ensuring that the division complies with Institute protocol.[5] Watson is also involved in the child synth project, although he has significant reservations about it and only continues with the testing specifically because of Father's involvement;[6] while he views Father's ideas as unconventional, he is still fond of the director, and they regularly share long conversations over dinner.[7]
Out of all of these tasks, regulations are Watson's greatest priority. He is constantly submitting new regulation updates to the Institute Directorate to address new developments,[8] and he has written safety handbooks which are thousands of pages long. He believes that safety cannot be compromised for efficiency, claiming to have seen various past incidences where researchers ignored procedures to work faster and ended up dead, and he will not change his mind on the issue.[9] He treats rulebreakers with disappointment, and by contrast, expressing measured discipline is the easiest way to gain his respect.[8][10] He is not completely inflexible regarding the rules, but committing even the most minor infractions will cause him to feel guilty.[11][12]
Watson's penchant for procedure brings him into disagreement with Rosalind Orman, who is constantly making new proposals and redesigns which he sees as unsafe. Watson ends up rejecting many of her proposals outright and brings his safety concerns straight to Orman for the rest, to her chagrin.[13][14] A related issue is Brendan Volkert, who frequently visits Orman during work hours just to be near her. Orman does not mind having Brendan around, but Watson sees his presence as a distraction to their work and would rather have Orman dissuade him.[2][15]
While Watson is content to work under Dr. Li and is willing to excuse her past involvement with the Brotherhood of Steel, he still sees her as an outsider and has privately warned that she cannot be fully trusted.[6] Meanwhile, although he recognizes the Brotherhood as a threat,[16] he admires their technology and would love to reverse engineer their designs for the Institute.[17][18]
When asked about the Facilities division, Allie Filmore will state that Dr. Watson is a member of Facilities who is in charge of the Institute's power distribution systems.[19] This is contradicted by several conversation scenes involving Watson where it becomes clear that he only works with the power allotment for Advanced Systems and is still constrained by Facilities regulations.[5][4] Allie's line likely confuses Evan Watson with Enrico Thompson, a Facilities member who states in his dialogue that he maintains the Institute's power systems.[5][20][21]",Evan Watson,vaulttecscientist,maleboston,NPCMEvanWatson,Human,Male,,400437,386401,YetAnotherModder,84,0005E561,0005E561,00061C35,NPCMEvanWatson,NPCMEvanWatson,EvanWatson,EvanWatson,

/wiki/Isaac_Karlin,"Doctor Isaac Karlin[1] (username Karlin.I)[2] is a scientist working in the BioScience division of the Institute in 2287.
Karlin firmly believes in the Institute's mission, and he holds himself and his colleagues to a higher standard as a result.[3] This has given him a sense of self-importance as well as a lack of faith in others, and he becomes easily offended by anyone who disturbs his research or fails the tasks he assigns them.[4][5][6] At the same time, this also makes Karlin come off as condescending, though he does not admit this and will only show the slightest approval for those who meet his expectations (or quickly change his tune for those who threaten violence against him).[7][8][9]
Karlin's research is focused on plant science. He spends much of his time managing and monitoring the plant specimens in Hydroponics, and he is proud of it.[10] He is very protective of the specimens and will have no end of complaints for anyone who touches them without his permission; Dean Volkert is one such offender.[11][4] Karlin is also heavily involved in the division's Warwick Homestead Initiative. One of his research areas is the creation of crops which are resistant to the irradiated surface conditions.[12] He has spent years studying this and developing genetically modified seeds which are tested on the surface at Warwick homestead, and because of this, he has a vested interest in the success (and continued secrecy) of the Warwick operation.[13] His long-term exposure to the project has even given him some sympathy for the Warwick family, though BioScience's director, Clayton Holdren, does not share his view.[14]
Another area which Karlin is involved in is the Synth Zoology Initiative. At Director Holdren's behest, Karlin catalogued anomalous incidences of aggression related to the synth gorillas, recommending that they either be destroyed or at the least kept isolated from human personnel for safety reasons.[15] Karlin does not see eye to eye with Director Holdren, believing that Holdren is overly patronizing and contemptuous towards him and is too proud of his own position.[16][17][18]",Isaac Karlin,vaulttecscientist,maleboston,NPCMIsaacKarlin,Human,Male,,400438,386397,YetAnotherModder,84,0005E55D,0005E55D,00061C36,NPCMIsaacKarlin,NPCMIsaacKarlin,IsaacKarlin,IsaacKarlin,

Head of the Synth Retention Bureau, Justin Ayo is essentially in charge of the Institute's security as well as its surface operations. Coordinating Coursers and regular synth infantry units, it is Ayo's responsibility to project power and hit the enemies of the Institute. However, his haughty, demanding attitudes towards other departments come at the cost of his own department's respect, and many disagree with his methods, particularly those from Robotics who delay his requested courser upgrade packages. His incessant bickering and demands cause much controversy within the Institute, situations that his second-in-command, Alana Secord, has to rectify ""half the time.""[2]
It does not help that whenever a courser upgrade is delayed or rescheduled, Ayo becomes infuriated and accuses other departments of purposefully spiting him. Alana has to work overtime in these situations, to prevent him from walking into said departments with a host of Coursers in tow.[3]
Technically, Ayo is merely filling the position of SRB director in the absence of Dr. Zimmer, who is supposedly away overseeing the retrieval of ""high profile"" synths.[4] In actuality, Dr. Zimmer has gone missing,[5] but Ayo takes pains not to let that be known.

Unbeknown to them, including his own father Alan Binet who is in charge of producing synths for the Robotics division, Liam is a leaker who serves as the primary link between the operatives of the clandestine organization known as the Railroad and the synths they seek to free.
Without the knowledge of his colleagues, this young mind shepherds gen-3 synths from the Institute out to the surface, with hopes that someone will answer his message and escort these fugitives to safety, away from the wrath of coursers and synth reclamation squads. Liam eventually becomes aware of the fact that he is instrumental to the success of the Railroad in the Commonwealth. 
In 2283,[2] Liam, under the codename ""Patriot,"" established communication with the outside world using the Trinity encoding algorithm given to escapees from the Institute.[3] Tinker Tom, a member of the synth liberation organization known as the Railroad, took the responsibility of maintaining contact with Patriot.[2][4] From then on, Patriot has benefited the Railroad as an informant and contact for gen-3 synths being forwarded out of the Institute, using his position as a scientist to help them escape to the surface through weak points in the security of the organization.
Patriot has proven vital to the success of the Railroad's cause in the region, yet he has been kept in the dark about his service to them in order to prevent his position from being compromised. For this reason, he is set to be surprised when the revelation comes around that he has been helping the Railroad free synths.
A pacifist by nature, Liam is opposed to violent methods, even if it is in the name of freeing synths. He is intolerant of armed conflicts and seeks no part of the upcoming synth rebellion against the Institute's directorate, backed by the Railroad. During the conflict in the Commonwealth, if the Sole Survivor sides with the Railroad, Binet, severely devastated by the fighting, takes his own life, a choice fueled by the hopelessness of the situation.
Following the armistice, the Railroad recovers Patriot's body and lays him to rest in the Old North Church. Desdemona tells everyone that Liam's death in the line of freeing synths should be honored, but she secretly presents the Sole Survivor with Patriot's suicide letter. In the letter, Liam expresses his dismay and anger at the Sole Survivor for using him in their plot to violently overthrow the Institute, as well as the deaths of all his friends and family, lost either in the violence of the uprising or in the harsh environment of the wasteland after being forced out into the world.

/wiki/Madison_Li,"Doctor Madison Li (Institute username Li.M)[1] is a major character and one of the most prominent scientists in the wasteland. 
She's found in the Rivet City science lab she oversees in¬†Fallout 3, and plays a major role in the game's story due to her experience with nuclear fusion. She disappears from the game in¬†the Fallout 3 add-on Broken Steel, in the wake of the main game's events, heading to the Commonwealth, where  she's encountered as the head of Institute Advanced Systems in¬†Fallout.
Madison was a young, idealistic scientist when she met James and Catherine. She became fully devoted to the idea of Project Purity, like the rest of the scientists who joined them, working tirelessly to see it through.[2][3] She developed romantic feelings for James over the course of their work, but she kept them hidden out of respect for James' marriage to Catherine. Though it strained her opinion of them, her professional relationship with them never changed.[4] The project faced complications and frequent super mutant attacks, but the support of the Brotherhood of Steel allowed them to make progress, though Madison personally did not trust the organization.[Non-game 1][5]
Even with the Brotherhood's help, things soon went downhill, with super mutant attacks intensifying and work on large-scale water purification hitting snags. Catherine's pregnancy, which had previously inspired the team to work harder, became the breaking point. When Catherine went into labor, Madison was able to deliver her child safely, but Catherine died during the childbirth. Afterwards, James chose to abandon Project Purity in favor of his child's safety. Madison's grief for Catherine's death turned into a feeling of betrayal by James, whom she still loved, and things quickly splintered apart amongst the remaining members, not least because Madison disliked the Brotherhood. They all left in the end, giving up on Project Purity.[Non-game 1][3][6][7][8]
After leaving Project Purity around 2259, Madison headed to Rivet City, having heard about the thriving scientific community set up there by Horace Pinkerton. Despite leaving the project behind, she had not given up on its mission, and continued her research into water purification. Pinkerton did not share her vision, seeing it as a waste of time. After numerous arguments and disagreements, Pinkerton left Rivet City and began to live in the bow of the ship, with the city at large believing he had disappeared.[9] With his departure, Madison took his place on the Rivet City Council and became the lead scientist of Rivet City,[10] organizing its science lab and directing the staff to work on hydroponics, water purification, and portable fusion power.[11] They began to grow healthy, radiation-free produce like fresh apples and pears. Her work there continued for the next 18 years, over which time she grew ""older, wiser, and much more cynical.""[Non-game 1]
It was here in Rivet City that Madison had her first exposure to the Institute in 2277 via Dr. Zimmer, who was then the director of the Synth Retention Bureau. Zimmer was in Rivet City requesting help from Madison's team to track down an escaped android, though his refusal to elaborate and condescending attitude towards their work earned him no favors. Madison refused to acknowledge his requests, seeing him as a distraction.[12]
In 2277, things drastically changed in Madison's life again. She received an unexpected visit from James, who had escaped from Vault 101, hoping to enlist Madison's support in reviving Project Purity. Madison angrily refused to help him, claiming that she had moved on and too much time had passed.[3][13][14] Secretly, she regretted this and hoped to see James again. Soon after their confrontation, she met the Lone Wanderer and helped them trace James' steps. After the Lone Wanderer rescued James and returned to Rivet City, she was very happy to see James again (even though she wouldn't admit it)[15] and she agreed to help restart work on Project Purity at the Jefferson Memorial with her team at Rivet City.
Shortly into their work, the facility was occupied by the Enclave under Colonel Augustus Autumn, who demanded for them to hand over Project Purity. James, still caring for Madison, pretended to comply and made sure she would be out of harm's way.[16] In the ensuing events, Madison's assistant Janice Kaplinski was killed and James sacrificed his life to hinder the Enclave.[17] Madison, despite her shock, managed to take charge and escaped with the Lone Wanderer and some other members of their team to the Citadel, taking refuge with the Brotherhood of Steel. Despite their past enmity, her continued distrust,[18] and her displeasure with working on weapons of mass destruction, Madison helped the Brotherhood prepare for war against the Enclave, using her work on portable fusion power to assist Scribe Rothchild in restoring Liberty Prime.[19][20]
Madison accompanied the Brotherhood during the final battle to reclaim the purifier. After the Enclave's defeat, she arrived to monitor the status of the purifier, finding it to be damaged. She informed the Lone Wanderer and Sarah Lyons via intercom that the purifier would need to be activated in the lethally irradiated control room or else the entire facility would explode, and soon, someone stepped up to the call.[21]
After helping the Brotherhood to restart operations at Project Purity, Madison left the Capital Wasteland. She still distrusted the Brotherhood, and she further disagreed with their military occupation of the Capital Wasteland and control of the purifier. Furthermore, she disliked their attempts to control and weaponize her research.[20][22] Finally, while Elder Lyons had allowed her to leave, other voices in the Brotherhood saw her as a security risk due to her status as an outsider with access to Brotherhood secrets, and she feared they would attempt to silence her.[23] Her destination was the Commonwealth, where she hoped to take refuge with a rumored scientific community.[24][25]
Madison eventually reached the Commonwealth and made contact with the Institute. Father extended an offer for her to join them, and she was only too happy to accept, wanting nothing more than peace from the Brotherhood. The Institute's scientific resources and intellectual community were above anything Madison had ever seen before, and she quickly dedicated herself to her research under the Institute's wing.[26] Though she has faced distrust for being an outsider,[27] Madison still rose through the ranks and became privy to some of the Institute's most sensitive projects, and as of 2287, she is the head of Institute Advanced Systems.
Madison genuinely believes that the Institute wants the best for all humanity.[26] Because of this, she is willing to overlook the organization's selfishness, isolation, and lack of transparency,[28] as well as Father's irrational behavior; Madison is disgusted by Father's child synth project but continues with it anyway.[29][30] She also suspects that Father is keeping secrets from her, but doesn't see that as enough of an issue to turn her back on the group.[28][31] However, there is one incident that may be enough to shake her allegiance: Madison was friends with Brian Virgil, the head of the FEV lab, who became disillusioned with his research and fled the Institute. The event was covered up as an accident, Virgil was declared dead, and the lab was sealed off despite Madison's insistence on a thorough investigation. Madison does not believe he is still alive, but is convinced that the circumstances were suspicious.[32][33]
Otherwise, Madison is fine in her day to day work at the Institute. Though she generally avoids socializing,[34] she has good relationships with many colleagues and even has a prot√©g√©, Rosalind Orman, whom she considers the best physicist (and overall one of the greatest talents) in the entire Institute. Her opinion of Evan Watson, another of her subordinates, is more neutral.[35][36]",Madison Li,Madison Li,Madison Li,NPCFMadisonLi,Human,Female,,2020391,386623,YetAnotherModder,100.0,0005E63F,0005E63F,001ED427,FemaleUniqueDrLi ,NPCFMadisonLi,CG00DoctorLiDoctorLiMadisonLi,MadisonLi,
/wiki/Max_Loken,"Max Loken (username Loken.M)[1] is a scientist in the Institute in 2287. 
An enthusiastic supporter of third generation synths and their development, Loken believes that the Institute is on the cusp of a breakthrough, creating beings superior in almost every way to regular humans. These third generation synths are, in Loken's opinion, a material improvement upon humanity and at the same time Father's gift to mankind. Naturally, it also makes his division, Robotics, the first among equals.[2]
While Loken is zealously devoted to advancing synth science, capable of talking for an hour and not covering the whole topic, he does not believe synths to be persons. To him, they remain machines and nothing more. In fact, he considers debating artificial sentience or souls in machines to be a waste of time, something that philosophers do, not men of science. This puts him at odds with his close friend, Alan Binet, and his impassioned speeches about synths' potential personhood. The arguments between them can be tense, including suggestions that Alan use the teleporter to get out of Loken's hair and the Institute's that helps shut the discussion down.[3]
The two remain friends despite their disagreements over synth status, and for good reason: Robotics is struggling to keep up with requests from other divisions of the Institute, including debugging faulty routines, general maintenance cycles, and many other tasks.[4] Binet is essential to keep the division going and Loken frequently delegates requests to him, ranging from courser musculature upgrades from the SRB,[5] through new linguistic software from Advanced Systems,[6] to mundane maintenance of gen 1s used by Facilities.[7]
Loken does draw the line at Eve, Binet's personal synth Alan requested after his wife's death. Both Alan and his son became attached to her, to the point that Max questions Binet's judgement and is concerned Binet's behavior might be construed as deviant, with all the consequences. While Binet explains this as a necessity for proving his hypothesis - close observation is a must - and Loken accepts it initially,[8] he remains concerned about the propriety of such a relationship and perception thereof. He is not alone in believing that living with a third generation ""unit"" is unprofessional, at best, due to any relationships that might emerge.[9]
However rocky his relationship with Binet might be, the one person Loken truly despises is Justin Ayo, head of the SRB. Ayo has a tendency to use coursers liberally for surface operations, including liberally using them up. At one point, Ayo lost three whole units in combat ops on the surface in less than a month, which caused Loken to refuse to complete future work orders from the SRB. He took it upon himself to inform Ayo, rather than forcing a subordinate to deal with the ornery division head.[10]",Max Loken,vaulttecscientist,maleboston,NPCMMaxLoken,Human,Male,,400442,386399,YetAnotherModder,84,0005E55F,0005E55F,00061C3A,NPCMMaxLoken,NPCMMaxLoken,MaxLoken,MaxLoken,

Nathan is the father of Quentin Filmore and the husband of Allie Filmore. He is optimistic about the synth Shaun, believing his development may be a key to a better future.
Although he tries to be a good father, the workload at Advanced Systems keeps him away from home and makes him unintentionally neglectful. Quentin is mostly self-sufficient, but even he is vulnerable to entire nights with their parents absent. Nathan typically relies on his co-workers to intermittently take care of him when he pulls late night nights with his wife. Janet Thompson, who has daughters herself, happily takes care of the young Quentin.[1]
In fact, by 2287, Quentin seems to deliberately misbehave to get attention from his parents, such as when he steals high grade stimulants from Dean Volkert's lab and feeds them to the synthetic gorillas. His parents punish him with grounding and making him prepare a hand-written apology, completely missing the desperate call for attention.[2] It doesn't help that Nathan routinely forgets promises he made to his own son, swamped by work.

/wiki/Quentin_Filmore,"Quentin Filmore (username Filmore.Q)[1] is the son of Nathan and Allie Filmore in the Institute in 2287. 
The only son of the Filmores, two of the most hard working members of Advanced Systems, Quentin has not developed the yearning for science his parents have. In fact, he considers science boring and a form of punishment.[2] The two things he did develop were a desperate desire for his parents' attention and a talent for pranks to get them to pay attention and spend time with him, as they often work late night shifts for multiple nights in a row, leaving him alone or at best arranging for him to have dinner with their work colleagues. The Thompson family is one such caretaker for Quentin,[3] who is all but used to his parents' absence[4] and is constantly being suspected of pulling more pranks.[5][6]
One of Quentin's typical pranks is hiding his father's notes to drive him crazy[7] or horseplay involving fellow adolescents and the concourse fountain. Alice and Julia, daughters of the Thompsons, top his list of targets.[8] However, he is also known for higher-tier endeavors, such as exposing the gorillas in the BioScience division to high grade stimulants stolen from Doctor Volkert.[9] As a rule, his parents fail to connect their absence with his behavior. They do not try to understand why Quentin is acting out as he is, and simply impose various punishments to make him learn his lesson, whether that is forcing him to apologize, grounding him at home, or even making him do public service via low-level maintenance duty.[10][11][12]
Parenting comes second nature to work for Quentin's parents. Even when Quentin reaches out to his dad to work together on his school projects, Nathan usually makes an absent-minded promise, then gets engrossed in his own work and forgets. When reminded, he makes excuses and endless promises to make it up next week, which never pans out. Quentin slowly gets used to being the least important thing in his parents' life, at least in his view.[13]

She is constantly thinking about how to improve and optimize the Institute's technology,[2][3][4] and she will often forgo sleep just to spend more time on her research work, even requesting more work when she has finished her current assignment. Nothing excites her more than research, and if she could, she would spend her whole day doing nothing but designing new technologies.[5][6] One of her main areas of interest is the development of high-energy weaponry such as plasma weapons.[2]
Dr. Li considers Orman to be one of the most brightest minds she has known and believes that she will be able to accomplish much.[7] Orman has a powerful memory and is able to memorize and even compare between schematics all within her head.[2] Conversely, anything that threatens to limit the amount of work she can accomplish, such as the Facilities division's power regulations, is undesirable to her.[8]
Orman frequently does not get along well with Evan Watson, who often tries to rein back her more radical ideas; in fact, he has rejected all twelve of her most recent research proposals.[9][10] She is amused by Brendan Volkert, who comes to her with physics questions in order to spend time around her.

His creation has drawn some minor controversy within the Institute; Madison Li expressed discomfort and irritation according to her personal holotapes as Advanced Systems has been tasked with the creation of Shaun. She was unable to understand the scientific need for the creation of a child synth, something that Father did not bother to divulge. Janet Thompson finds his existence pitiful, although Nathan Filmore believes the child synth can lead to a better future.
When the Sole Survivor arrives at the Institute to locate their child during Institutionalized, they are briefly led to believe that the synth Shaun is the real one in order to test the child's responses. Shaun responds negatively and calls for help from Father before being deactivated. Father then acknowledges that he is still a prototype and does not work well.
If the player character completes one of The Nuclear Option quests, and synth Shaun is not left behind in the Institute, he will ask them to bring items so he can 'take it apart' and in return will build useful items for them, such as weapon mods and the Wazer Wifle.
Additionally, the player character can ask Shaun to live with them and can send him to a number of locations, similar to a companion, although he is not able to be assigned to beds, like many other NPCs. He cannot be commanded to move throughout the settlement. He will stay within the confines of a small area (e.g. near the Minutemen radio operator in the Castle).
If the player character instead completes the Nuclear Family quest, Shaun will be interactable and found within the Advanced Systems Lab. They have the ability to choose where Shaun will live by talking to him. If one subsequently decides to move him to another settlement, it must be done via the workshop interface. Shaun will sometimes ask for all sorts of parts in order to build something.",Shaun,Clem,Shaun,NPCMShaun10,Synth,Male,,377656,356547,YetAnotherModder,100.0,000570C3,000570C3,0005C338,,NPCMShaun10,,ShaunChild,

/wiki/Z1-14,"Z1-14 is a maintenance synth living in the Institute in 2287. He is instrumental during the finale of the Railroad questline.
A simple maintenance synth on the surface, Z1-14 is secretly Liam Binet's partner in crime, working towards synth liberation. As of 2287, he has identified thirteen more synths who wish to flee the Institute. While Liam wants to get just this dozen out, Z1-14 plans to free them all in one go, touching off a mass uprising of Institute slaves. His careful entreaties revealed that the number of volunteers wishing to rise up against the Institute is much greater than he anticipated.[1]
As such, he and Binet began stockpiling weapons and equipment to arm the synths and craft their own weapons. so that the numerically superior synths can strike back with more than just fists. Binet's privileged position allowed for organizing Z1-14 and his fellow rebellious synths into a single work crew, making planning easy.[2] To completely free the rebels from surveillance, Z1-14 came up with a plan to acquire a shipment of mining equipment, which would provide all the materials for crafting weapons, and fake the rebels' deaths in a construction accident that's rare enough to allow them to get away, but not so uncommon as to raise suspicion.[3][4]
There is one point of difference between Binet and Z1: While Z1-14 does not wish harm to come to the scientists and hopes the Railroad can find a less drastic solution, if forced to choose between eternal slavery or lives of every scientist at the Institute, he will choose freedom.[5] He's well aware that the choice will likely force the destruction if the institute, as the SRB is already a threat with a mere fraction of the Institute's resources. A successful rebellion would likely make the Directorate enter a war footing, pouring resources into the Bureau to kill or recapture all rebellious synths, fighting as long as necessary to achieve that goal.[6]",Z1-14,MaleEvenToned,maleboston,NPCMZ114,Synth,Male,,867514,862712,YetAnotherModder,84,000D29F8,000D29F8,000D3CBA,NPCMZ114,NPCMZ114,Z1-14,Z1-14,

/wiki/Arthur_Maxson,"Elder Arthur Maxson (Registration MX-001E) is the last descendant of the Maxson lineage. He served as a squire in the Citadel in 2277 in¬†Fallout 3 and is currently the supreme commander[2] of the East Coast chapter of the Brotherhood in 2287, during the events of Fallout.
Born in 2267 to Jonathan and Jessica Maxson, Arthur is a descendant of the legendary Roger Maxson, founder of the Brotherhood of Steel. His father, a high-ranking paladin serving just outside the New California Republic, was recently killed in battle, and his mother, Lady Maxson, sent the boy east to be raised under the tutelage of the then respected Elder Owyn Lyons.[3] Squire Maxson tends toward timidity, which is the main reason his mother sent him to the Citadel.[Non-game 1] Part of the reason were internal conflicts in the Brotherhood out west, which created an unsafe environment for Arthur.[1]
Ever since arriving at the Citadel, Arthur was an attentive student, with a good knowledge of the Brotherhood's triumphs and history.[4] He has also proven himself to be a keen observer, making accurate observations of the local super mutant threat and even observing a behemoth from the Citadel walls once.[5] Overall, he received a top notch education, thanks to excellent teachers and trainers at the Citadel.[6] Of course, he learned the Codex by heart, though the protocols gave him particular trouble,[6] especially when it came to encounters with outsiders. The Codex deemed them untrustworthy, yet Elder Owyn Lyons was content to violate them as he saw fit, such as when accepting the Lone Wanderer into the Citadel without taking the Oath of Fraternity. For a boy whose only real encounters with outsiders were Brotherhood members visiting the Citadel,[7] he was surprised by the decision, but deferred to Elder Lyons' judgement, despite his reservations.[8][9][10]
He was also trained in combat by Sentinel Sarah Lyons, who on one occasion showed him how to kill people by stabbing them in the kidneys.[11] Maxson viewed Sarah like an older sister; she was gentle and caring to him, and taught him about fighting and leadership.[12]
Despite being a young boy, Maxson was faced with high expectations as the last of the Maxson line. He was expected to become the Brotherhood's great new leader, and he was told his ""soul was forged from eternal steel."" He never believed this claim.[3]
Loneliness also weighed heavily on the young Maxson. As the only child at the Citadel, he grew up surrounded by adults, with no one of equal age to spend time with. Given that everyone he worked with was a soldier, he didn't receive kindness or warmth, merely schooling and training.[13] His closest friend was Liberty Prime, an inanimate robot. Scribe Rothchild banned him from the laboratory, emphasizing the futility of trying to make friends with a machine.[14] He snuck into the Lyons Den to read Paladin Vargas' copy of Guns and Bullets without his knowledge since he wouldn't give it to him otherwise.[15]
As a result, the ten-year-old Arthur had a timid and reserved demeanor. It wasn't helped by the fact that the young boy was barred from patrols due to accidentally shooting Sarah during one outing.[16] Arthur's reservations and apprehension helped him maintain a level of politeness and decency that would later translate into unmatched charisma.[17][18][6][7]
The key change in Arthur Maxson's life came with adolescence and the death of Elders Owyn Lyons and Sarah Lyons. While the crumbling Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel chafed under the ineffectual leadership of one elder after another, Maxson rapidly developed his talents, the potential inside awakening. In 2279, at the age of 12, he managed to kill two raiders on a training patrol, saving the squad that was supposed to escort him. A year later, he managed to single-handedly kill a deathclaw, taking grave wounds in the process and a disfiguring scar that marred his face forever. His key achievement came in 2282, at the age of 15, when he killed a super mutant leader named Shepherd, who was trying to reorganize the remnants of the Capital Wasteland super mutant infestation. This achievement has revealed another secret, that the West Coast elders were still monitoring their errant brethren. With Maxson's achievement came leadership and promotion to a provisional elder.[19]
Though young, Maxson was ready to lead and reunite the fragmented Brotherhood of Steel forces on the East Coast. He proved his ability in 2283, when he brokered a peace with the Brotherhood Outcasts, re-integrating them into the Brotherhood of Steel. The sixteen-year-old Maxson was proving himself as effective a diplomat as a warrior. The full force of the Brotherhood of Steel appointed Arthur Maxson as the elder, the youngest in Brotherhood of Steel history,[20] and supreme commander of the entire Brotherhood of Steel, with the ability to strike anywhere on the East Coast because of the Prydwen, launched just a year before his rise to power.[20]
As of 2287, Elder Maxson's reign in the Capital Wasteland was uncontested, and his authority and influence were spreading across the East Coast. The Prydwen was a key element of the Brotherhood's power projection, rallying people to his cause. In addition, Maxson had the full support of the elders on the West Coast, who proudly reported that cults existed worshipping Maxson as a god, although these groups had to be eradicated. However, Maxson was offended by the idea of being referred to as a deity, as it goes against his beliefs. Maxson is, instead, satisfied with being (according to the Brotherhood) the perfect human specimen, an example of everything a human being can achieve; assisted, even enhanced, by advanced technology, but still very much human.[21]
His authority is reinforced by his accomplishments, growing the Brotherhood in the East from a moribund group of complacent stragglers occupying a single Citadel into a major military force capable of projecting power along the Eastern Seaboard. Thanks to his tenacity and singular vision,[22] the men that serve under his command do so with pride[23] and unmatched loyalty, with one soldier mentioning they were ready to invade hell itself.[24]
Although his beard and facial features give him the aura of an older man, Maxson is still close to being a teenager, and he is quite young and idealistic as a result. He has established an amalgam between the ways of his predecessor and tutor Elder Owyn Lyons, who was using technology to help others and the traditional Brotherhood approach of coveting and preserving advanced technology to protect people from abusing it. As a result, he is much more lenient about technology being in the hands of outsiders, and allocates teams of soldiers to combat dangers that would otherwise harm or kill the people of the wasteland,[25] while he has other teams scouring the ruins for technology that could be misused in the wrong hands. Maxson also strongly insists that the Brotherhood has the best interests of the Commonwealth in mind.
He deeply cares for everyone under his command, as he was exceptionally reluctant to allow Ingram into the field as a field scribe despite Knight-Captain Cade's professional opinion that due to her power armor frame (which replaced her legs and much of her lower torso), she was more suited for combat than scribe-work, in fact probably better suited than any knight they could muster.[26] Additionally, he explicitly ordered that all technology was to be traded for food and medicine, and violent confrontation was to be a last resort, which drastically sets him apart from the West Coast Brotherhood, who used violence as a first resort. This shows that not only does he not wish to risk the lives of those under his command, but he does genuinely seem to care about the people of the Commonwealth.
He also approved a request by Senior Scribe Neriah to develop a more effective alternative to the pre-War RadAway, showing that he has also carried on Lyons' efforts of improving technology as opposed to simply hoarding it, which remains the West Coast's goal, as can be seen through a conversation between Nolan McNamara and Veronica Santangelo in Fallout: New Vegas.
He can usually be found in the Citadel B ring, where his room (and personal terminal) is located.
Maxson, along with the Prydwen, will show up in the Commonwealth once the quest Reunions is completed. He can usually be found in the main command deck of the Prydwen or in his living quarters.
He will join the Brotherhood attack on the Institute during the quest Ad Victoriam, and become a temporary follower in The Nuclear Option. If the player character sides with the Institute, during the quest Airship Down he will arrive from the Prydwen in a Vertibird. He will be wearing his personal T-60 power armor wielding his unique Gatling laser, Final Judgment.
In the Railroad main quests, he is largely unmentioned only until Rockets' Red Glare, where he can be confronted while or after sabotaging the Prydwen. He will be wearing his battlecoat and Gatling laser, but not his power armor. If the Commonwealth Minutemen destroy the  Prydwen during the quest With Our Powers Combined, he will not be present during the Brotherhood's retaliation on The Castle.

As the airship's captain, apart from piloting the great airship, Kells is also responsible for order and discipline among the crew.[7] He is also responsible for overseeing the training of members, particularly the squires, ensuring they get the education and training they need, as well as the chance to experience combat up close.",Lancer Captain Kells,LancerCaptainKells,LancerCaptainKells,NPCMLancerCaptainKells,Human,Male,,117781,410290,YetAnotherModder,97.0,000642B2,000642B2,0001CC15,NPCMLancerCaptainKells,NPCMLancerCaptainKells,BoSLancerCaptainKells,BoSLancerCaptainKells,

/wiki/Ingram,"Proctor Ingram, registration IG-444PR,[1] is head of engineering and the proctor for the Order of the Shield at the Prydwen in 2287. 
Proctor Ingram is a woman with the drive and tenacity matching that of Arthur Maxson. Bound to her power armor frame, Ingram lost her legs in combat in the Capital Wasteland, as a result of a hundred-foot fall that left the power armor she was piloting totaled and both of her legs crushed, fit only for amputation above the knee. The cause was that the power armor staging area she was stationed on was positioned along a ridgeline overlooking the battlefield. It took a mini-nuke in the fighting, causing the cliff to shear right off and with it the platform she was standing on. The rest was history.[2]
However, Ingram refused to just give up. As a talented engineer and programmer,[3] she continued to work for the Brotherhood regardless of her injury, eventually achieving one of the highest honors for a Scribe: The rank of Proctor and a posting to the Prydwen as the head of her engineering team. As such, it was her team that pulled the fusion plant from the derelict aircraft carrier and installed it within the Prydwen for its Commonwealth journey.[4] However, her biggest desire is to return to the field and fight among soldiers. Although her customized power armor frame was designed with that opportunity in mind (over a period of six months in cooperation with Knight-Captain Cade) and she rigorously trained in it to a degree that surpasses the abilities of other soldiers,[5] it was her skill as an engineer that was her undoing. As head of the Prydwen's engineering team and a crucial member of the Scribe order, Elder Maxson simply could not afford to clear her for field service. If she was lost, it would be a bigger blow to the Brotherhood than losing a whole combat unit.[6] He also had another reason - Proctor Ingram was necessary for the completion of a top-secret project the Brotherhood was completing within the Commonwealth.[7] So important, in fact, that when she inevitably disobeyed the Elder and assisted a field team at the Mass Fusion Building, the Elder overlooked this blatant disregard. Her only punishment was receiving a strongly-worded letter from the Elder.[8][9]
On a personal level, she is close friends with both Cade and Teagan. Cade is constantly looking for excuses to make her come into his infirmary,[10] while Proctor Teagan tries to cheer her up by digging up goods that she has a weakness for, like sweets, shared in the comfort of his cabin.[11]

/wiki/Quinlan,"Proctor Quinlan, registration QN-448PR,[1] is the head of the archives and R&D division, and proctor for the Order of the Quill on the Prydwen in¬†Fallout.
Highly intelligent and methodical, Proctor Quinlan is one of the oldest members of the Commonwealth expedition.[2] A Capital Wasteland native, he is deeply interested in what bounty of knowledge the Commonwealth has to offer.[3] His primary duty on board the Prydwen is sifting through the immense amount of material recovered from the region, trying to identify useful information among the sea of what he considers useless noise, such as fiction and poetry:[4] Technical volumes, repair manuals, design philosophies and assorted medical research, anything to enhance the Brotherhood's technical knowledge.[5] Anything that doesn't is just a waste of paper, as far as Quinlan is concerned.[6] Other scribes don't agree with his stance, but Quinlan has the benefit of his position and has pulled rank to ensure that fictional material is kept off the Prydwen.[7][8]
Quinlan immediately set up a two-pronged system of recovery to maximize recovery rates: First, he secured an authorization to pay a bounty for recovering documents, anything that might contain technical data, down to memos, charts and blueprints, in addition to the aforementioned books. Second, he organized a research patrol system,[9] with scribe-soldier pairs recovering any and all documents and artifacts they can find.[10] The two-man teams help maximize efficiency, by having them do a quick pass to evaluate a location's technical and historical relevance, instead of sending in an entire retrieval team to a potentially useless location.[11] Brotherhood members also have standing orders to turn in any technical documents to Quinlan for analysis,[12] as well as recovered historical, social documentation, and other artifacts.[13][14] Lancer-Captain Kells also has any soldiers who haven't participated in one of Quinlan's patrols sign up for them.[15][16] While the patrols are widely known to be dangerous, some scribes volunteer for the assignments so as to escape from soldiers who they consider to be disgusting and/or unintelligent.[17]
Additionally, Quinlan is Maxson's most trusted analyst, responsible for identifying strategic targets,[18] aiding the reconstruction of Liberty Prime,[19] evaluating key intelligence recovered in the war against the Institute.[20][21] The elder has not known Quinlan to make mistakes.[22] Quinlan is a staunch supporter of Maxson's policies and considers the Institute's research to be ill-conceived, to be stamped out with extreme prejudice for the risk that they pose to humanity at large.[23] He has patrols follow up on every lead, no matter how far-fetched it might seem,[24] coordinates duty rosters with Lancer-Captain Kells to track down the location of the Institute,[25] and collaborates with other scribes to better understand the enemy.[26] Scribe Neriah is one of his most trusted aides, especially when it comes to sensitive intelligence.[27] He does dislike her tendency to be distracted by her special projects, though.[28]
Quinlan executes his duty with a single-minded devotion to duty and the Brotherhood, and particularly dislikes anyone badmouthing his fellow scribes (after all, the Brotherhood would have no intel or support capacity without them),[29] or disrespecting superiors (which can quickly result in disciplinary measures).[30] In fact, he dislikes showing any disrespect, regardless of rank, especially since any members might have to give their lives in the line of duty, and the Brotherhood honors them all.[29] As far as he knows, Brotherhood scribes are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to further the Brotherhood's knowledge,[31] and he personally believes that death in pursuit of duty is honorable.[32] He doesn't think that everyone should pursuit such a goal, and the best way is to accomplish the Brotherhood's goals without sacrificing Brotherhood lives. He is an outlier among his peers, believing that if it can be helped, the Brotherhood should use alternative forces as cannon fodder, if necessary, to minimize Brotherhood casualties.[33] However, his empathy has limits. When one of the most loyal members of the Brotherhood is outed as a synth, Quinlan immediately makes a 180 on his topic, and his only regret is that the Brotherhood was completely unaware,[34] due to a lack of preparedness.[35]
Quinlan does have a softer side, all things considered. He has a pet cat Emmett, who accompanies him at work, and though he keeps his temper in control most of the time, he lets himself go when dealing with obstinate technology, down to cursing and kicking unruly objects or robots.[36][37] Despite his refusal to acknowledge fiction, he hypocritically has a soft spot for Grognak the Barbarian, being an avid collector of comic books and other series paraphernalia, as per the 2076 Underlane Price Guide. Field scribes know to be on the lookout for any Grognak books and items, especially the rarest limited annual issues. Quinlan does hate if such priceless items are returned damaged, though.[38] Unbeknownst to him, his stash is preyed upon by other Brotherhood members to read comic books.[39]

He is also the man responsible for engineering Maxson's battlecoat.
He sells a variety of gear to the discerning customer, as long as they are a member of the Brotherhood of Steel. However, he keeps the best gear reserved for higher-ranking members, which the Sole Survivor will be able to purchase as they rise through the ranks of the Brotherhood.

/wiki/Buddy,"Drinkin' Buddy, also called Buddy, is a modified Protectron, located in the basement of the Shamrock Taphouse in 2287.
The owner of the Shamrock Taphouse, Patrick Merryweather, created a mobile microbrewery from a Protectron. Once he had a working prototype, he contracted with the Hotel Rexford with the intent of serving ice cold beer to hotel patrons. The project was fronted by Jack West, the manager of the establishment.[1]
To build the robot, the entrepreneur started with a consumer RobCo Protectron, stripped out the robot's main assembly and replaced it with a custom miniaturized micro brewing unit fabricated with unlicensed parts (thus voiding its warranty) that was capable of flash-fermenting mash, producing alcohol at a faster rate and ice cold. He designed the robot to accept recipe holotapes, thus allowing it to brew a wide range of different types of beer, also programming in a wide variety of jokes to be told for the customer's amusement.[2]
However, the Hotel Rexford was under contractual obligations to only serve Gwinnett beer. As a result, Patrick was unable to use his own recipes. However, he managed to get in contact with a person who was able to illegally crack the encryption on one of the brewery's proprietary brewing holotapes. This allowed the robot to produce Gwinnett pale ale by default.[3]
After days of tinkering and perfecting, Patrick managed to finish the robot. He knew Gwinnett had copyright to their alcohol, but he hoped to be in full production or work something out with Gwinnett before the Gwinnett Brewery's lawyers caught up with him. The final product was Drinkin' Buddy, the ultimate automated drinking experience. He designed the robot to be ready for mass-production with the main customers being bars and restaurants. Patrick had the original prototype unit scheduled for delivery to the Hotel Rexford, thinking he should rent a truck because Drinkin' Buddy walked slow.[4] However, this was cut short by the Great War, leaving Buddy still inactive in his charging pod, his delivery 210 years behind schedule.[5]
He can be given holotapes containing alcohol recipes that he will store in his inventory. He can also change regular beers and soft drinks into their ice cold variants granting 35 AP in addition to the usual STR/CHR +1, INT -1; this is done by following the dialogue option to request a beer but instead placing drinks into his inventory. Alternatively, the recipes may also be removed just by trying to talk to him. Drinks that one can give to him to make ice cold are any Gwinnett beverage, any Nuka-Cola and any Vim.
Giving Buddy any ""Gwinnett,"" ""Nuka"" or ""Vim"" will cause it to become ice cold after about 12 hours in-game time. This increases the benefits of most items upon consumption by a variable amount but does not remove the rads present in the beverage.
To give Buddy recipes, one must play the recipe holotape on their Pip-Boy. Once this is done, the Sole Survivor automatically initiates dialogue by stating ""Buddy, I have some recipes for ya...,"" after which they are removed from the inventory and Buddy will be able to produce them in the future. If this dialogue doesn't trigger when speaking to him with a recipe in one's inventory, try dropping the recipe from the inventory and picking it up again. This especially helps with recipes obtained prior to meeting Buddy.

/wiki/Arlen_Glass,"Arlen Glass is a ghoul living in The Slog in 2287.
Cofounder of Wilson Atomatoys, Arlen was the lead toy designer until October 21, 2077. He worked tirelessly alongside his friend George Wilson to make toys to help children dream and to imagine a better future.[1] It was their passion that they pursued for the next 35 years, often at the expense of time spent with their families. Their flagship product, the Giddyup Buttercup (created by Arlen), became a smash hit on the market, eventually bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue per year, in spite of its excessive price tag ($16,000 per unit).[2]
However, as the years went by, the pressure on both of their families only increased. Arlen neglected his wife and daughter for years, focusing on his work as much as possible,[3] while George missed his son's birthdays, graduation and his wife's funeral. He brought on Marc Wilson as vice president in a bid to reconnect and eventually abdicated his position as company president to him in late 2077, believing that Marc grew into the toy business, despite initial reservations.[4] His son, turned bitter by years of parental neglect, immediately turned his back on his father's legacy. Sales forecasts for the fourth quarter of 2077 were fudged at Marc's orders so that sales of the Giddyup Buttercup would show decline in from $122,000,000 to $110,000,000, a year-over-year loss of 17%. They cited brand stagnation and market saturation at the current price point as reasons for the continuing decline.[2] While Arlen reacted to the news with incredulity,[5] he immediately set about finding new ways to enhance the brand's appeal. These included collectible variants (e.g. mythical horses), alternative markets for boys, Premium Princess lines, as well as promotional tie-ins with Hubris, Nuka-Cola and Vault-Tec. Marc, on the other hand, had other ideas.[6]
The new president made a bid for the secretive SCYTHE Program initiated by the United States government to bolster their wartime production by converting part of the Atomatoys factory into an ordnance production facility.[7] His application was accepted on September 1, despite doubts by some of the Pentagon staff, as the Atomatoys factory exceeded the requirements specified for the project. Colonel Thomas Nelson, director of the SCYTHE Program, scheduled a visit in person while Wilson and Nathaniel Hawke set about converting three of the five assembly lines for military production of land mines.[8] The first phase of the conversion was completed by October 15, a week ahead of schedule, with production scheduled to begin on November 1.[9]
Arlen was kept out of the loop. He tinkered with leg servos[10] and new paint schemes (missing his daughter's recital),[11] while none of the executives returned his calls or moved forward with his licensing proposals. By October 20, Arlen was desperate to make any sort of headway on his projects, to have something to show at the board meeting.[12] He did not expect to see a representative of the military at the meeting, much less hear about the values of the company being betrayed in favor of patching its budget by manufacturing weapons for the Army.[13] Forty-five minutes into the board meeting, Arlen exploded and had to be removed from the premises by security. He tried in vain to enter and talk to Marc Wilson to dissuade him from the course he chose, but only succeeded in being removed several more times and forcing security to notify the police.[14][15] The CEO fired him immediately.[16] His dismissal was a shock to all employees of the company, who considered him to be the heart and soul of the place.[17]
Arlen made one last bid to try and convince Marc to change his mind on the morning of October 23, 2077. He left his Cambridge apartment and made his way to the Wilson Atomatoys headquarters. Although he was promptly removed, he managed to convince the security guard to deliver his final plea to Marc, who promptly threw it in the trash. When the bombs started dropping, Arlen tried to make his way back to his family in Cambridge, but when he came home, he only found a massive, irradiated crater. Traumatized, he lay among the ruins, wanting nothing but to die and join his family. Instead, he survived, and the radiation from the crater turned him into a ghoul.[18] He kept on going, using his talents as a toymaker and expert engineer to get by, always haunted by the memory of his family and especially young Marlene, lost without so much as a goodbye. His focus on toys and technology helped him stay sane for over two hundred years, eventually settling down at the Slog, helping out the ghoul farmers with his expertise and trying to put one more Giddyup Buttercup together, for old times' sake and to perhaps gift it to a child in the wasteland. Although a wrench and a tool is far cry from the high-tech facilities he once had at his disposal, he keeps on going.[19]

Should the Sole Survivor investigate the Vault's hidden sector and relieve her of duty, she will offer her services as a companion.
The state of the art Curie was designed to be the guardian of Vault 81, responsible for preserving the knowledge amassed by the Vault 81 scientists, as well as ensuring that every single one is aware of the significance of the mission undertaken within the halls of the vault.[3] However, the current Curie is not the same robot as when she was deployed to the Vault. Due to the overseer's sabotage, none of the science staff received a notification about the drill that would have allowed them to enter Vault 81 in time to carry out the experiment.[4] However, three researchers showed up: Kenneth Collins and Jim Flint reached the Vault from the Fens with the general population, while the overachiever M. Burrow was already on site. They reported to the research area and were sealed inside. This meant that the danger to the residential population still existed.[5]
Although there were only three of them, ensuring that the generations-long research plan would die out, they had state of the art equipment, centuries' worth of supplies and the Contagions Vulnerability Robotic Infirmary Engineer (CVRIE), meaning that with even their limited manpower, they could still be a threat to the residential population.[6] To compensate, Collins upgraded and modified Curie, from a customized Mr. Handy into a fully fledged lab assistant.[7] He provided her with a custom personality inspired by two female acquaintances of his, Liza and a French girl from Versailles he had met decades earlier, also loading the databanks with every great body of work he had (Kant, Einstein, Born, Darwin, Faraday, Turing, Braun, and her namesake, Curie), and knowledge of at least French and Japanese in addition to English,[1] to make her more lifelike and human. As such, CVRIE became Curie.[8] With her help, the work picked up the pace and quite soon, the Phase I trials began. When notified of it, Overseer O. Olivette was mortified and played for time,[9] while maintaining an aura of camaraderie, taking care to not reveal her intentions. While the mood among the three researchers remained stable thanks to Collins and Curie, they still had access to the nozzles and could release the pathogens for a Stage III trial, or worse.

/wiki/Curie,"Contagions Vulnerability Robotic Infirmary Engineer (CVRIE),[2] or Curie, is a heavily-modified Miss Nanny designed by Vault 81's covert research team in the aftermath of the Great War. Should the Sole Survivor investigate the Vault's hidden sector and relieve her of duty, she will offer her services as a companion.
The state of the art Curie was designed to be the guardian of Vault 81, responsible for preserving the knowledge amassed by the Vault 81 scientists, as well as ensuring that every single one is aware of the significance of the mission undertaken within the halls of the vault.[3] However, the current Curie is not the same robot as when she was deployed to the Vault. Due to the overseer's sabotage, none of the science staff received a notification about the drill that would have allowed them to enter Vault 81 in time to carry out the experiment.[4] However, three researchers showed up: Kenneth Collins and Jim Flint reached the Vault from the Fens with the general population, while the overachiever M. Burrow was already on site. They reported to the research area and were sealed inside. This meant that the danger to the residential population still existed.[5]
Although there were only three of them, ensuring that the generations-long research plan would die out, they had state of the art equipment, centuries' worth of supplies and the Contagions Vulnerability Robotic Infirmary Engineer (CVRIE), meaning that with even their limited manpower, they could still be a threat to the residential population.[6] To compensate, Collins upgraded and modified Curie, from a customized Mr. Handy into a fully fledged lab assistant.[7] He provided her with a custom personality inspired by two female acquaintances of his, Liza and a French girl from Versailles he had met decades earlier, also loading the databanks with every great body of work he had (Kant, Einstein, Born, Darwin, Faraday, Turing, Braun, and her namesake, Curie), and knowledge of at least French and Japanese in addition to English,[1] to make her more lifelike and human. As such, CVRIE became Curie.[8] With her help, the work picked up the pace and quite soon, the Phase I trials began. When notified of it, Overseer O. Olivette was mortified and played for time,[9] while maintaining an aura of camaraderie, taking care to not reveal her intentions. While the mood among the three researchers remained stable thanks to Collins and Curie, they still had access to the nozzles and could release the pathogens for a Stage III trial, or worse.

/wiki/Nick_Valentine,"Nick Valentine is a synthetic private detective living in Diamond City in 2287. Following their awakening, the Sole Survivor hires him to help locate their missing son, after which he offers them his services as a companion.
An unusual robotic detective, Nick Valentine is the sole detective of a small agency he runs in Diamond City alongside his assistant Ellie Perkins. In addition to possessing the memories of a late pre-War detective, Nick has certain abilities that complement his investigative skills: he is very effective at hacking computers, and adept at both ranged and melee combat. Valentine believes himself to be a prototype between second-generation synths and the latest, which might explain why he exhibits sapient intelligence and is not innately hostile towards non-Institute humans.[1] He is generally well respected throughout Diamond City despite his mysterious origins.
The synth that became Nick Valentine was created by the Institute over a century before 2287. He was one of two unique prototype Gen 2 synths used to test if and how synths could handle independent thinking and personalities. Nick was implanted with an artificial personality based on memory recordings of pre-war humans while the other synth, named DiMA, was allowed to develop his own personality based upon experiences.
For years Nick was experimented on, having various personalities and memories from former humans loaded into him. Despite this, he and DiMA grew a family-like bond to one another due to being the first and only synths of their kind. This was until DiMA grew to resent the experiments being performed on him and his ""brother."" The two synths managed to escape, but not before the Institute uploaded a new personality and memories in DiMA's brother.[2][3]
The synth, now identifying himself as a pre-War police officer named Nick Valentine, was left in a state of confusion due to suddenly ""waking up"" 200 years in the future. He attacked DiMA, who was left with no choice but to knock Nick out and leave him behind.[4] After regaining consciousness in a pile of garbage an unknown amount of time later, Nick wandered the wasteland in a state of confusion for several weeks.[5][6]  He eventually forgot about his past relationship with DiMA due to the limited capacity of his prototype brain. 
Due to unfamiliarity with the Institute and its technology, most wastelanders regarded Nick with equal parts fear and awe. However, he was eventually accepted into a small local community where a mechanic helped repair the damage he had sustained in his travels. During this time Nick befriended a child named Jim who became his first remembered human contact. The community was the first group to treat Nick as a human being rather than a mechanical monstrosity since his reawakening. Nick eventually left that settlement; upon visiting years later, he found that it had been destroyed by raiders.[7]
Nick eventually found himself traveling to Diamond City. Although Diamond City held no small amount of hatred for the Institute and their synths, Nick gained their respect by saving the daughter of Henry Roberts, the mayor at the time, after she ran away with a caravan trader. The trader and his companions were, unbeknownst to the girl, actually kidnappers who proceeded to take her hostage. Nick stumbled upon the kidnappers by pure accident while wandering the Commonwealth. Finding himself being held at gunpoint, Nick scared the abductors away by claiming that he had a bomb inside him and making beeping sounds (literally by saying the word ""beep"" repeatedly).[8]
When the mayor's daughter told Nick what had happened, he brought her back to her father, who rewarded Nick with a house in Diamond City despite citizens' objections. Nick gradually eased the citizens' fears by acting as the city's handyman, and helping to track down missing people. His formidable detective skills were revealed when he helped to find a wife who was presumed dead; Nick discovered that she had only run away with her lover. In time, people stopped asking Nick to fix things as it became clear that he had found his true calling as Diamond City's private investigator.[9]
While on a case to find a woman named Darla, who was believed to have been kidnapped but had actually run away to join mobster Skinny Malone (an ""old pal"" of Nick),[10] Nick was captured and imprisoned within Malone's hideout in Vault 114.
It is in Vault 114 that Nick meets and is rescued by the Sole Survivor. The two escape the vault after a confrontation with Skinny Malone and Darla. Upon their escape the pair meet up at Nick's office, where the Sole Survivor enlists his help in tracking down their missing son.[11]
Nick eventually opens up to the Sole Survivor and starts the quest Long Time Coming. Nick asks them to help him tie up the last ""loose end"" of the original Nick Valentine's life: bringing down his old rival Eddie Winter. After tracking down all 10 of Winter's old holotapes, Nick and the Sole Survivor use them to decode Winter's hideout and the code to get in. Once inside, Nick confronts a ghoulified Winter (who does not recognize Nick due to his synthetic nature). Together, with or without the Sole Survivor's intervention, Nick kills Winter and avenges the murder of the original Nick's fianc√©e, Jennifer Lands.[12] Nick then shows the Sole Survivor the site where Winter had killed Jennifer, before contemplating who he is and what purpose his life has after that point.
While traveling with the Sole Survivor, Nick finds himself on a case to find the missing daughter of Kenji Nakano, who apparently worked with Nick on a prior case that wound up with Kenji getting shot in the hip. The trail leads to Far Harbor. While on the island, Nick is reunited with DiMA, who is now the current leader of Acadia. Though DiMA is very glad to see his brother again, Nick is reluctant due to not remembering DiMA at all.[13] Upon finding proof of their relationship, the Sole Survivor can convince Nick to accept DiMA as his brother, and the two will occasionally greet each other or chat upon entering Acadia.
The original Nick Valentine was a police detective from Chicago.[14] He was brought to Boston to lead ""Operation Winter's End,"" an operation to bring down mob boss Eddie Winter.[15] Unfortunately, Winter or one of his associates managed to find out about Nick's fianc√©e, Jennifer Lands, and killed her in revenge for Nick's involvement in the operation.[16] The Bureau of Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco, Firearms and Lasers, otherwise known as BADTFL, received intelligence of associates of Winter discussing her whereabouts, but senior officers decided not to place Jennifer or Nick into witness protection in order to avoid compromising the investigation.[17] To make matters worse, Nick and the rest of the task force on Operation Winter's End discovered that Winter made a deal with the BADTFL and the district attorney to incriminate his associates in exchange for immunity.[18]
In the weeks preceding the fall of the bombs, Winter was released and Operation Winter's End was disbanded. Nick was ordered to seek treatment for PTSD at the Commonwealth Institute of Technology, where his brain was scanned as part of his treatment. This was how the Institute was able to obtain Nick's pre-War memories and implant them within a synthetic body.[verification needed] Though the synth Nick is aware that he is not the original, possessing the original's memories means that he shares the human Nick's traumas and emotions, including his anguish over Jennifer Lands' death and desire for revenge against Eddie Winter.",Nick Valentine,Nick,Nick,NPCMNickValentine,Synth,Male,,12069,12068,YetAnotherModder,100.0,00002F24,00002F24,00002F25,NPCMNickValentine,NPCMNickValentine,CompanionNickValentine,CompanionNickValentine,
/wiki/Skinny_Malone,"Skinny Malone is a leader of the Triggermen who reside at Park Street station in the Boston Common in 2287.
Skinny Malone and his crew inhabit the station and the Vault-Tec vault (Vault 114) located underneath. Although he is very short-tempered and relies on the comfort of Darla, he is still hesitant when it comes to decision-making, especially if she leaves or doubts his integrity.
Like the other Triggermen, Malone has based his appearance and persona on that of old pre-War Chicago mobsters. He is known to keep a ""black book"" of people whom he is angry with, with three strikes across the name meaning the person is likely to be killed. According to Nick Valentine, Malone was a small time player who was eventually driven out of the ""old neighbourhood"" by more powerful gangs.

When the Sole Survivor speaks with Janey, Roger's daughter, she says that her father is a lot nicer than he used to be. This change came when the human Roger Warwick was replaced with a synth built by the Institute some time before the Sole Survivor's arrival, taking over his life. Compared to the original Roger, a drunkard who barely worked on the farm, the synth is a much kinder and more hardworking individual who expresses seeming care for his family. His family attributes the change to a period of time in their near past when super mutants destroyed their crops and left them to starve, believing that the near-death situation gave him a new perspective on life.[1][2] This idea works to Roger's advantage, as it helps him explain other quirks of his being a synth, such as the fact that he no longer requires sleep. When his family comments on this, he passes it off as trauma-induced insomnia.[3][4] Despite being a synth infiltrator, Roger has genuinely come to care for the Warwick family as though they were his own.[5]
Roger is a key component of the BioScience division's Warwick Homestead Initiative, a plan to test genetically modified seeds on the surface. The Institute intends to retrieve Roger and the crops following the end of their testing, and all evidence of their presence would be purged alongside the retrieval.[6] However, this plan is not foolproof.

Abernathy farm was one of several settlements that Ack-Ack and her gang frequently extorted. On one such occasion, the family's eldest daughter, Mary Abernathy, attempted to stand up to her, only to be mercilessly gunned down.[1] Before leaving the family to grieve, the raiders added insult to injury by stealing Mary's locket, an heirloom that had been in Connie's family for generations.
The Sole Survivor reaches Abernathy farm to find Mary's father, Blake Abernathy, still on edge after Ack-Ack's last arrival. When the Sole Survivor expresses sympathy after hearing Blake's account of his daughter's death, Blake desperately urges them to go after Ack-Ack and retrieve Mary's locket.

He had been isolated after his Yangtze-31 struck a mine not long after the Great War, the radiation from the damaged reactor turning the captain and his crew into ghouls.[2] When he made it into port at Boston, the city was already in ruin. The chaos from the direct aftermath of the Great War was still underway which prevented anyone from particularly caring about a Chinese stealth submarine docking at Boston Harbor.[3]
For two centuries, he eked out an existence scavenging what he could from the destroyed city and fighting off raiders, gathering intelligence and information that would, one day, help him repair the vessel and return to China, where he hopes to help rebuild, or at least be able to die in his home country.

/wiki/Conrad_Kellogg,"Conrad Kellogg is a ruthless, highly skilled mercenary acting as the main surface operative of the Institute in the Commonwealth. He is the secondary antagonist of Fallout.
Kellogg was born on the West Coast and raised in one of the settlements that would become a founding member of the then-infant New California Republic.[3] In his youth, he lived in a dysfunctional and impoverished household with his abusive father, and his cynical, imposing but loving mother. Being an alcoholic and abusive parent, Kellogg's father was unreliable as a provider for the family. Instead, Conrad's mother turned to her son for support, while also teaching him that relying on others was foolishness and that the only things in the world he could depend on were himself, his gun and his will to survive in the wasteland. Kellogg eventually ran away from home believing it was for a better place and life when in reality, he was fleeing from the guilt and humiliation of being unable to protect his mother from his father's abuse. Due to being mentally scarred beyond repair and being left with a misguided sense of judgment, Kellogg chose the lawless and criminal way of life. He joined raider gangs in his teen ages to survive, fighting for every scrap he could find. This hard lifestyle also toughened up Kellogg with a strong sense of independence which is something he learned from his mother but it was not enough for him to protect her and stay which misled him to recklessness, impulsivity and becoming a sociopath. 
Growing up to be a young adult after a youth of hopelessness and despair, he became a highly skilled mercenary and hitman who took dangerous contracts to kill people or complete any kind of task in return for large amounts of profit. Kellogg had made a name for himself shooting someone named ""Valdez,"" and his reputation got him a job working for the Shi as a guard and enforcer that he accepted as a more stable and secure line of work. 
He eventually met a woman named Sarah on a night in the Hub. They eventually married and moved to San Francisco, where they had a daughter, Mary. Some time later, his job became risky again which came at the cost of his family being murdered by unknown assailants from an unknown faction. Kellogg was devastated by the traumatic loss of his wife and kid and this fueled him with an insatiable bloodlust which led him to brutally kill the faction to avenge their deaths. This did not give him peace, and only left him more broken on the inside. 
Kellogg traveled eastward, fleeing from bad memories. He became a mercenary again, but this time, he was more brutal and willing to do any job no matter how dirty, killing men, women or even children, though he claims to not enjoy the act of child murder. Eventually, he reached the East Coast and finally the Commonwealth, where he settled in Diamond City and came across rumors about the Institute. Kellogg's line of work interfered with the Institute's operations, prompting them to send a proxy to confront and eliminate him. Defeating this assassin, he tracked the Institute down in turn and convinced them to hire him by effortlessly eliminating several synths trying to kill him. Since then, he has been their primary surface operative; even though many in the Institute despised him for being a ""dirty surface degenerate,"" his extensive experience working in the wasteland made him indispensable. Among the tasks he performed was acting as the main human contact for the attempted tech retrieval at University Point,[4] and later commanding a synth legion to destroy the settlement when they could not produce the preferred results. Kellogg's many bloody exploits put him at the top of the Railroad's hit list of Institute targets.[5]
Kellogg was eventually tasked with leading a team of Institute scientists to invade Vault 111. The Institute required radiation-free test subjects, and the vault's cryogenically-preserved residents were perfect candidates. The Institute learned of an infant, Shaun, and dispatched Kellogg to retrieve him from the vault. After finding the pod containing the boy in one of his parents' arms, the team opened it up to retrieve the child. Kellogg ended up killing the confused and defenseless parent of the infant after they refused to give up their son. Kellogg then turned to the surviving parent, remarking that at least the ""backup"" would be unharmed. Kellogg had the unharmed parent put back into cryo-stasis and was directed to not release the other residents and to keep their life-support systems deactivated, causing all of them to asphyxiate. Shaun's DNA was then used by the Institute to complete the generation 3 synths. 
At some point, Kellogg was cybernetically enhanced by the Institute, which slowed his aging and extended his lifespan. By 2287, he is over 100 years old but physically appears to be less than half of that, looking much the same as when he kidnapped Shaun 60 years before. Kellogg was sent, against his better judgment, to Diamond City with a synth sharing the appearance of a ten-year-old Shaun. Kellogg described it as a ""pet project"" of the Old Man,[6] although he realized later that he served as bait for the Sole Survivor.[7] He eventually abandoned the house after X6-88 came to collect the synthetic Shaun on behalf of the Institute. He was then tasked with tracking down the rogue Institute scientist Dr. Brian Virgil, who had recently fled from the Institute. In preparation for this job, Kellogg set up a base of operations in Fort Hagen, though he became injured in several battles on his way from Diamond City, forcing him to take time to recuperate in Hagen.
With the help of Dogmeat, the Sole Survivor tracks Kellogg to his base of operations. They fight through Fort Hagen's synth detail as Kellogg taunts them, offering the Sole Survivor a chance to turn back. As the player character approaches, Kellogg takes note of their determination and allows them a chance to talk to him, revealing himself and ordering his synths to stand down. Kellogg informs the Sole Survivor that Shaun is no longer with him, but with the Institute. The conversation inevitably leads to a fight which results in Kellogg's demise. Kellogg suspected that this was the plan all along, to tie up a loose end.[7]
The Sole Survivor can access Kellogg's memories with the use of his cybernetic brain augmenter, and the aid of Nick Valentine and Dr. Amari. After leaving Kellogg's memories, the last echoes of the mercenary's consciousness speak to the Sole Survivor through Nick's body, taunting them one last time.",Kellogg,Kellog,Kellog,NPCMKellogg,Human(cyborg),Male,,638065,638060,YetAnotherModder,86.0,0009BC6C,0009BC6C,0009BC71,NPCMKelloggMQ203MemoryA_KelloggChildVoice,NPCMKellogg,,Kellogg,

Chronologically, the Stranger has been seen assisting members of the Vault 76 reclamation effort, the Vault Dweller, the Chosen One, the Lone Wanderer, the Courier, and the Sole Survivor. He has also been spotted at ease within certain active Vaults. 
Similar figures to the Stranger have also been seen in post-War America, such as the Mysterious Savior, a different man wearing identical clothing who provides life-saving healing, and Miss Fortune, a non-lethal female counterpart who wears a veil and a revealing armored showgirl outfit. Additionally, the Mysterious Stranger sometimes appeared to the Chosen One as a woman.[1]
By 2287, the synth detective Nick Valentine has built up a casefile investigating the Stranger.

He wears a tan, worn trench coat that is buttoned down the middle, on top of a collared white shirt and red tie. He has a fedora that matches his coat, with a darker brown band. He wears olive green pants and brown shoes. He appears to player characters who take the Mysterious Stranger perk.
In Fallout Shelter, the Mysterious Stranger appears in Vault rooms or elevators and a sound is played when he does so. He does not aid in battles, but may appear in the Vault regardless of if the Vault is experiencing an incident. When selected, he disappears and the Vault is awarded a random amount of caps. If any rooms are not powered, he will not appear, even when the sound effect occurs. He can spawn at anytime, appears with a smoke poof and leaves with one as well.

/wiki/Brandis,"Paladin Brandis is a paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel living in the Commonwealth in 2287.
Paladin Brandis was assigned as the commander of Recon Squad Artemis, with the objective of traveling to the Commonwealth to gather technology and intelligence from the region.[1] Shortly after their arrival, they were ambushed southeast of Malden Center, as raiders outnumbered them five to one. In the fighting, they lost several soldiers, including Knight Varham, and they were forced to scuttle their power armor. Paladin Brandis then ordered the survivors to make for the local National Guard training yard as their fallback point.[2] Once there, they made camp for a short time, before Brandis ordered Knight Tara Astlin to hold the position until their return, though she was soon overrun by feral ghouls.[3] At some point after she started her distress beacon, Paladin Brandis and Scribe Faris were separated. While Paladin Brandis was quickly trying to reach Knight Astlin, Scribe Faris was attacked by super mutants. In the firefight, a bullet to a vital artery caused Faris' eventual demise at the Revere satellite array.[4] Unable to reach either Knight Astlin or Scribe Faris in time, Paladin Brandis, now alone in the Commonwealth, made his way north to a previously discovered bunker where he would take shelter.[5]
Now alone and shocked by survivor's guilt, he would attempt to continue his mission, but after three years in isolation and no hope in sight, his paranoia and fear bested him, losing all hope of rescue.
If Brandis is convinced to return to the Prydwen, then upon talking to him there, he will thank the Sole Survivor and give them his gun, the Survivor's Special.

/wiki/Tower_Tom,"Tower Tom is the leader of a gang of raiders at the Beantown Brewery in 2287.
A very muscular raider, Tom is the leader of a group of raiders based out of the Beantown Brewery. He has ambitious plans for his gang's expansion, including eventually taking the Corvega assembly plant or D.B. Technical High School. He and his gang are also said to be impossible to appease; Bunker Hill, noticing that Tom's gang was steadily expanding east, sent multiple messengers to make a deal ensuring he would not interrupt their trade routes, but they were all chased away and one was even killed.[1]
At some point when his gang's food supplies ran low, he attempted to raid the federal ration stockpile held by Red and Lily and their gang. The raid went disastrously and half his crew were killed, but two of them managed to capture several hostages, including Lily. After having Lily write letters to Red to convince her that she had been taken, food was sent to Tom's crew to keep her alive. However, after several shipments, Lily managed to get loose and Tom accidentally killed her while trying to aim for her leg. To hide this deed, Tom spread rumors of a huge caravan to temporarily lure his crew out. While they were away, Tom stashed Lily's body inside some unspecified vats, saying she ""improved the flavor.""[2]
Tom then tried to continue deceiving Red by writing letters and pretending to be Lily, so she would send more food to his crew. However, he was unable to convincingly forge the letters, and Red grew suspicious, eventually sending one of her men to spy on the brewery and determine if Lily was still there.[3]
Tower Tom had sent out Sparta to the BADTFL regional office to look for food and supplies.[4] It is also possible that the raiders Bull and Gouger work for Tom as they bring Vadim Bobrov to Beantown Brewery, Tower Tom's hideout.
If the Sole Survivor takes out Tower Tom before attacking Red Tourette, Red's terminal in the federal ration stockpile will have an updated log saying that she thinks Lily has escaped from Tom. Conversely, if the Sole Survivor takes out Red before clearing Beantown Brewery, Tom's terminal in the brewery will have a log where he is thankful for the sudden opportunity.

She put the lab at the Four Leaf fishpacking plant to be naturally guarded by the feral ghouls there, as well as its waterway access for transportation. She even picked an all-ghoul work team to operate the lab so that the ferals would not bother them, on top of an intricate security system and a password she picked out. So far, her system has been foolproof, and this is a fact of which she is proud.[3][4][5]
As a result of her position, Trish acts as Marowski's representative in an ongoing deal smuggling chems into Diamond City. Trish regularly meets with Henry Cooke and Nelson Latimer to oversee their transactions. This arrangement works well overall, but recently Cooke and Latimer have been underpaying them for their product, which she and Marowski do not tolerate.[6] Despite, or perhaps because of all this, Trish has a highly nervous disposition, especially when things seem to be wrong.[7][8]

Gorski was a self-taught explosives expert, patriot, and survivalist that owned a property in the wilderness south of Concord before the Great War.[1]
Following the recent installation of an innocuous electrical pylon tower, this outdoorsman accused the United States government of building the installation to house a ""mind control device"" designed to manipulate the free-thinking people of the United States. Mr. Gorski took it upon himself to destroy this eyesore, located right outside the front porch of his home. He used his knowledge of explosives to attempt to construct a homemade atomic bomb using parts from a mini nuke and barrels of nuclear waste he had somehow acquired.
It would appear Gorski's plan to create a bomb never came to fruition, as the bombs had already fallen before he could enact his plan.

They were successful in their mission until a group of the Mechanist's robots headed by Jezebel attacked the Rust Devils. The deathclaw awoke and attacked, killing multiple Rust Devils and robots. The Rust Devils managed to kill the deathclaw and capture Jezebel who was leading the robots.

Being the leader of an entire raider group with a knack for robots and technology, Ivey is far better equipped than any other raider boss in the Commonwealth and can pose quite a challenge to defeat. In fact, she utilizes better gear than most Brotherhood soldiers. Her threat level is compounded by the fact that she is backed up by a powerful automatron in a fight at close range.
According to Jezebel, Ivey is a sadistic and ruthless individual hellbent on torturing information out of her. In fact, she suggests that Ivey was the one who ordered the severing of her head from her body. Although other members of the group do not seem to show such aggressive tendencies, Ivey's actions caused Jezebel to harbor a deep grudge against the Rust Devils, as evidenced by her sadistic dialogue.[citation needed]

/wiki/Jezebel,"Jezebel is a dismantled robobrain in the Fort Hagen hangar in 2287.
Jezebel possesses a very rude personality, making no secret of her doubts in the Sole Survivor's abilities. She wastes no opportunity to belittle their allegedly minuscule intelligence.[1] She is fully aware of her hostile personality and even mentions it to the Sole Survivor at one point.[2] Saving and rebuilding her does not change her attitude in the slightest. She will vocally complain about her new body, regardless of its components.[1]
Compounding Jezebel's unfriendly behavior is the fact that she is a prime example of many robobrains' tendency to misinterpret orders and follow their abstract logical reasoning to highly dubious conclusions. During the conversation following her rebuilding, she mentions that she is, in her opinion, helping the human population of the Commonwealth.[3] When pressed by the Sole Survivor on how she can possibly claim to be helping humans when she is actually killing them, Jezebel reasons that the logic of attempting to help humans survive has a 25% percent chance of success, or in other words, a 75% percent chance of the humans dying anyway no matter what she does. She, therefore, deduced that simply killing them right away is the most efficient solution as it only serves to hasten mankind's inevitable fate and spares them the suffering of their existence.[4]
The Sole Survivor first meets Jezebel during Headhunting as a disembodied robobrain's head deep within the Fort Hagen satellite array, where she is held captive by the Rust Devils. She offers the Sole Survivor information on the Mechanist in exchange for her rescue and the Sole Survivor constructing a new body for her. 
Once her demands have been met, she honors her end of the bargain by revealing the Mechanist's location and how to enter the mysterious figure's hideout.

/wiki/DiMA,"DiMA is a modified synth on the Island in 2287. He is one of the founders[1] and leader of Acadia.
DiMA, alongside Nick Valentine, is one of two early prototypes created by the Institute to test if synths could handle independent thinking and judgement.[2] While DiMA was allowed to freely develop his own personality through experience, Nick was outfitted with alternating, pre-existing human personalities.[3] The two formed a close sibling relationship while in the Institute together and DiMA, not being able to bear seeing his brother put through such cruel experiments, decided to run away with Nick and the duo eventually managed to escape.[4] However, disoriented by the experiments done to him, Nick did not recognize DiMA after escaping. Believing himself to be the human Nick Valentine, Nick attacked DiMA, forcing DiMA to knock him out and then abandon him.[5]
Afterwards, DiMA traveled to Far Harbor to hide from the Institute, though without a programmed objective. He sat in a cave doing nothing for nearly a year before it occurred to him that he could define his own path in life.[6] He then went on to live in an old nuclear-armed submarine base that was eventually discovered by the Children of Atom.[7] DiMA befriended their leader, Confessor Martin, and eventually gave them the base as their home.[8]
Alongside Faraday, a synth scientist that acts as his assistant, and Chase, an ex-courser that DiMA was able to convince to defect from the Institute, DiMA went on to found Acadia with the intention of creating a safe place for synths to live freely and not have to hide their nature.[9] From there, DiMA was able to develop fog condensers to protect the residents of Far Harbor from the Fog, which consequently angered the Children, as the Fog is sacred to them.[10]
With tensions high between the Children, Acadia, and Far Harbor, DiMA, desperate for peace and safety for his own people, created contingency plans in the event that either group endangered Acadia.[11] For the Children, it was acquiring the key to the nuclear missile in the Nucleus, and for Far Harbor, it was acquiring the shut down codes for the town's wind farm and only power source. Then, in his desperation, DiMA chose to kill Captain Avery and secretly replace her with a synth as to have a ""moderate voice"" to be an example of how synths and humans could live side by side.[12] DiMA was so sickened by his own actions that he chose to remove these memories and, as a sign of good faith, put them in the Nucleus' computers for the Children to safeguard.[13]
Sometime later, DiMA and Nick are reunited when Nick and the Sole Survivor travel to Far Harbor looking for Kasumi Nakano. While DiMA expresses surprise and excitement to see Nick again, Nick is far more reluctant, not having any memories of DiMA due to their last encounter being over a hundred years prior‚Äîmemories DiMA has been able to maintain through his many modifications. However, if the Sole Survivor encourages Nick to accept DiMA as his brother after finding the holotape of their fight, Nick will apologize to DiMA and the two will occasionally greet each other or chat when entering Acadia.

/wiki/Jule,"Jule is a synth living in Acadia on the Island in 2287.
Jule (previously named Victoria) is a female synth living in Acadia in 2287. At an unknown point, Victoria escaped from the Institute and found her way to Far Harbor and then to Acadia. She was a friend to the residents there, until she was swayed to go on a boat ride with Faraday. She felt very nervous about the ride, but was apparently comforted by Faraday's looks.[1]
The boat crashed, with Victoria receiving severe damage to her head, resulting in Faraday having to mind-wipe her in order for her brain to function properly. But there was an issue with the mind wipe, resulting in Jule now mentally damaged, jumping between two distinct personalities in her speech, and having severe issues with her memories.[2] By the time the Sole Survivor arrives, she is very moody and sarcastically angry. She refuses to speak to the player character until the quest Data Recovery. She apparently suffers from nightmares about the crash, and only confides in Cog.
Although she states that she will be leaving Acadia following the end of The Price of Memory, she will simply sit on the ground outside of the observatory.

Kasumi Nakano is the daughter of Kenji Nakano and Rei Nakano. She and her grandfather used their mechanical knowledge to restore the pre-War appliances around her house.[2][3]
After restoring a radio and contacting DiMA by chance, she is led to believe that she is a synth who has replaced the real Kasumi Nakano.[4] This belief is reinforced by her feeling like she does not fit in at home, a lack of childhood memories to the degree she cannot remember entire years, being unsure if she used a swing set near her house,[5] and inexplicable dreams about waking up in a lab's white room while feeling a jolt of electricity to the back of her head and being stared at by mysterious people.[6][7] Although she does have her own doubts as to if this is the truth,[8] she cannot prove it.[9]
She later flees to Acadia, although she can be convinced to return after completing the add-on. If Far Harbor, the Brotherhood of Steel, or the Institute attack Acadia, she will die in its defense.
Kasumi is curious and empathetic, as shown by her pursuit of DiMA's radio signal and her desire to help the people of Acadia. When she was living with her parents, she was frequently bored, as she was isolated from the wasteland in her remote home. Her grandfather's passing worsened this feeling of boredom.

She has been a permanent resident of Far Harbor since approximately 2279,[4] eventually becoming captain of the Harbormen. She is accepted among her peers,[5] and Mitch points out her moral superiority by calling her ""holier than thou,"" albeit in a slightly mocking tone.[6]
As the leader of Far Harbor, Avery is involved in the increasing conflict on the Island, attempting to keep the peace with both Acadia and the Children of Atom to the best of her ability,[7] even though her attempts to resolve conflicts peacefully are frequently hampered by Allen Lee's hostility towards everyone who is not part of the Harbormen.[8]
However, unbeknownst to everyone involved, at some point in the past Captain Avery was murdered by DiMA and replaced by a synth.[9] This was done by DiMA in an attempt to infiltrate Far Harbor and to protect his people,[10] and the remains of the real Captain Avery, alongside her locket, are located in the basement of the Vim!

She often refers to the island as if it was a sentient entity that responds to the acts committed by those who live there and considers the Sole Survivor to be the one hero who can fight back against the dangers it imposes on Far Harbor inhabitants.
Her personal quest revolves around avenging deceased members of her family, sending the Sole Survivor on extermination missions after creatures of the Island, such as fog ghouls and a fog crawler, and finally, after a trapper leader who killed her husband, Danny Dalton.

/wiki/The_Mariner,"The Mariner is the shipwright, handyman and landowner of Far Harbor in 2287.[1]
The Mariner is one of the residents of the town of Far Harbor. She was the original inhabitant of the pier on which the town of Far Harbor was built and is in charge of the town's defense and upkeep.[1] The Mariner can usually be found in her home near the town's gate or doing repairs to the pier close to it. She can also be found doing repairs for the shop of Allen Lee. When not doing repairs on the hull or shops near it, she will be found inside of Allen Lee's shop.
While initially resentful of the intrusion on her residence and lifestyle, as the years passed, The Mariner became increasingly dedicated to the protection and unification of the Fall Harbor residents, eventually sending the Sole Survivor on a series of quests to help her reinforce the town's defenses. She remarks that she is the only one who actually does the work necessary to secure the town, often brushing it off as her protecting her own home, but admitting that seeing the residents safe and united is important to her.
After showing support for her efforts and completing the first stage of Hull Breach, she will initiate the second stage and comment on how it needs to be done quickly. If the player character asks her why the rush and completing a medium difficulty speech check she will reveal to the Sole Survivor that she has a terminal illness that is said to have been incurable even before the war. With the emotional support of the Sole Survivor, she dedicates her remaining time to ensuring the town survives after she dies.
After completing all of her quests, she will invite the Sole Survivor to accompany her on one last adventure to destroy a legendary monster that had been preying on ships for decades as a final legacy and to ensure the town's continued safety. When it turns out that this monster is merely a tiny mirelurk the size of a rad chicken with eyes that emit a bright red glow, causing curious captains to run aground when investigating, she is somewhat crestfallen that her legacy will be seen as a joke. The Sole Survivor can either convince her to embellish the story, lie and say they never found it, or tell the truth to the townsfolk.
After the events of her quests, the Mariner will remark that she is glad to have met the Sole Survivor and that she considers them to be a true friend.

/wiki/Small_Bertha,"Bertha and her family were among those who had to flock to Far Harbor for safety following the Island once again becoming covered in the Fog. Passing through the fog-covered ruins of the town, they made it to the docks; the only place relatively safe from the radiation and fog dwelling fauna. The Mariner, overwhelmed by the sudden flood of refugees, almost kicked everyone out, then Avery stepped in, effectively establishing the settlement. It was here that Bertha's mother, Peggy, discovered that her great-aunt Candace fled the island for the mainland once her home was engulfed by the fog. Seeking a safe haven for her family, her mother left her two children with their father Mark to travel to one of the Dalton family farms, hoping to trade work as a farmhand for shelter.[1] After Peggy left, she was killed and almost the entire Dalton family suffered a similar fate. Later her father would die as well, leaving Bertha and Tony poor and alone amongst the dregs.
Since then, she has acquired a reputation as the informal leader of the dregs of Far Harbor. Known now as ""Small Bertha"" (or ""Smalls""), she is considered crazy by some, but she is actually a competent, hardened and determined girl.[2] She has watched the Harbormen dwindle as they are forced to leave the island entirely in search of food and shelter. Now with the Far Harbor‚ÄìAcadia alliance, and with the fog condenser technology, she will enlist the Sole Survivor to help reclaim a lost Harbormen settlement; Echo Lake Lumber, which was abandoned long ago as the fog rolled in.[3][4][5][6] She is unaware that its owner is still alive, the last survivor of the family still clinging to his property, driven insane and cannibalistic.[7]",Small Bertha,FemaleMariner,femaleboston,DLC03FemaleBertha,Human,Female,,23684,23683,YetAnotherModder,84,03005C83,xx005C83,03005C84,DLC03FemaleBertha,DLC03FemaleBertha,,DLC03SmallBertha,

The Mariner, who has been diagnosed with a serious illness, is another one of Teddy's patients. He developed a correspondence with Bedine, a medically knowledgeable associate, to try and find a cure. However, Bedine confirmed that her condition was terminal, and there were no solutions in their old world archives.[5]
Teddy is friendlier to mainlanders than most other Harbormen, as mainlanders typically have more manners than the usual company on the Island.[6] He is also hard of hearing, a trait that can be seen in multiple conversations with him.[7][8][9]

A native of the Island, Longfellow is old enough to remember previous occasions when the radioactive Fog covered the majority of the island, before its eventual retreat. His indomitable will and physical fitness have served him well into his old age.
Old Longfellow is a seasoned hunter who can recall a fairly large portion of the region's history, from desperate struggle to prosperous hubris. Longfellow is a veritable legend in Far Harbor circles and one of the few guides capable of guiding a person safely through the Fog. His age and experiences made him cynical and he hits the bottle of whiskey a bit too often in recent years.
Longfellow harbors a deep distrust for the Children of Atom. In his youth, he was in a romantic relationship with a girl named Hannah and the two had planned a future together. The cult's followers attacked the pair at their hideaway deep within the Fog and abducted Hannah. Left for dead, Longfellow eventually made it back to civilization. It took him two months to recover from his injuries and by then it was too late for Hannah. The Children's zealots had brainwashed Hannah's mind and converted her to their ways. Hannah was pregnant but suffered a miscarriage due to the radiation she worshipped and was exposed to, claiming it was ""Atom's will"" for it to have happened. Hannah later fell victim to trappers.

/wiki/Devin_(Far_Harbor),"Brother Devin is a fasting devotee of the Church of the Children of Atom at the Nucleus in 2287.
Once a wastelander, Devin was a Jet addict, to the point where his addiction caused his family had to shun him. His father would say that he had no son, as Jet killed him. With no family or home, he wandered the woods getting high on Jet when he came upon the Nucleus after weeks of travel. It was there that he acquired the quest to go to Atom's Spring and drink from its waters. There he had a vision:[1] A messenger from Atom strode from the sky before him in the form of a verdant stag wreathed in glowing radiation. It commanded him to return to the Nucleus, to leave behind his iniquities and give himself fully to Atom. For his dedication, Atom would send another messenger, who would free him from his dependency on Jet once and for all.[2][3]
This vision was seen favorably by the Children, seeing him as special and that Atom had chosen him. Determined to make his god and new family proud, he embarked on a long fast.[1] This fast of only irradiated water, however, is detrimental in that Devin was born without a resistance to radiation, and with him avoiding anti-radiation medication to obtain a revelation,[2] his friend, Zealot Ware, has become concerned for him. They previously bonded over how they both needed a hand, which their new family provided.[4] Devin's prolonged fast will cause him to inevitably perish, which is a source of much frustration for Ware.[5]
Now that Devin looks like a ghoul with hair, Ware's concern has him seeking the help of the Sole Survivor. As both a new convert and the one who saw the Mother of the Fog,[6] Ware seeks the Sole Survivor's help in getting Devin to end his fast. The others in the cult see Devin's devotion as admirable rather than detrimental,[7] even at the cost of committing blasphemy, which is something he must avoid because of the current political climate within the Nucleus.[8]
Ware has tried to convince Devin to end his fast to save his life, but Devin will have none of it.[9] This is because since the day of his vision, he has not taken a single hit of Jet, knowing that a return to his old ways is just as suicidal as if he starved to death.[10]
If the Sole Survivor cannot convince Devin to give up the fast, and that he has freed himself from his addictions,[11] Ware creates a plan for the Sole Survivor to impersonate either Atom or a messenger of his.[12] If the Sole Survivor goes through with Ware's plan and irradiates themselves without wearing a mask Devin will recognize the Sole Survivor and assure them that he will keep their identity as a messenger for Atom a secret. Whether the Sole Survivor does wear a mask or not he will tell others in his family about his vision.[10] If the Island has peace following the Children of Atom's Reformation, Devin will believe that the depths of Atom's compassion never cease to amaze,[13] however, if the Children are successful in shutting the power off to the fog condensers and subsequently Far Harbor is engulfed by the Fog, he sees their punishment as the cost of refusing Atom.[14]",Brother Devin,childrenofatommale01,maleboston,DLC03CoAMaleBrotherDevin,Human,Male,,17523,17519,YetAnotherModder,84,0300446F,xx00446F,3004473,DLC03CoAMaleBrotherDevin,DLC03CoAMaleBrotherDevin,,DLC03CoA_BrotherDevin,

Lieutenant Brian Richter was not always the grand zealot. Far in the past, he was a soldier of the Enclave,[1] fighting in the Capital Region. The change came when a long-term scouting mission to recover a reserve of fusion cores went sideways. The disposal facility they tracked them to was still working. The containment cellar suddenly locked itself, due to a screw up by the team engineer. Fifteen inches of lead-wrapped steel slammed shut behind them and locked tight. Surviving on two sips of water and a bit of radroach per day, Richter watched his team fall apart and die. It seemed hopeless until Zealot Tektus came along, who broke the seal on the door and pulled him out.

Sister Mai is the general supply merchant and a mechanic of the Nucleus, originally from the Commonwealth. She does not communicate with her family anymore, as she fully embraced the cult as her new family. This is evidenced by her trying to help a homesick Child of Atom. They wanted her to acquire some of the famous ""Power Noodles,"" though she had no reference for its taste and instead promoted her recipe.[1]
She also carries a stock of anti-radiation medicine for Children who do not have congenital radiation resistance, giving the Children both the ability to ""scour"" themselves, as the practice became known in a sort of penance. She can be a good source of information on the group's beliefs and practices.[2]
As a general mechanic, she successfully modified the decontamination arches at the entrance of the Nucleus. This pet project of hers was done so the Children would have a place for ablutions. However, she is lacking an industrial-grade pump regulator to complete the modification.[3][4][5][6] Her simple modification can be easily reverted as it was itself merely a bypass, although this would disappoint the Children.[7][8]
As a devout Child of Atom, she is wary of the effects the loyalty tests have on their appearance, although she agrees with its lessons and results. She expresses to the Sole Survivor that trust is important among members, and encourages them not to fall into disfavor with the high confessor.[9][10][11]",Sister Mai,FemaleMariner,femaleboston,DLC03CoAFemaleSisterMai,Human,Female,,17529,17517,YetAnotherModder,84,0300446D,xx00446D,3004479,DLC03CoAFemaleSisterMai,DLC03CoAFemaleSisterMai,,DLC03CoA_SisterMai,

An older, partially blind woman, the Archemist is a Far Harbor native and was the doctor of the coastal town before High Confessor Tektus and Confessor Martin came north at the behest of Confessor Cromwell, speaker of Atom in the Capital Wasteland. While most harbormen saw them as a nuisance, Anna saw Atom's light in them and received their message well.[1]
However, this meant that she was driven out of town with the rest of Atom's children, and found home in The Nucleus.[1] Her beloved was also among these adherants, but he has since abandoned the faith.[2] Brought to the Nucleus on a stretcher, she continuously teeters on the brink of death, yet that doesn't stop her from healing those who come seeking her aid.[3] Despite the years of dedication to Atom, she still remains somewhat fond of her hometown.[4]

/wiki/Theil,"Zealot Theil is the second-in-command of the zealots, under Grand Zealot Richter, of the Nucleus in 2287.
Theil is the highest-ranking zealot after Grand Zealot Richter, whose job is to ensure the fitness of other zealots in their fight against the unbelievers.[1] As a zealot, she also serves as a form of law enforcement for the community.[2] She comes from a family of homesteaders who tried to settle on the Island years before the Fog covered most of it. She lost her family when a massive radiation storm hit the Island, killing her parents and leaving her the sole survivor due to her natural radiation resistance. After wandering for days, she came to Atom's Spring and drank from its waters. Suffering a hellish vision, she was ultimately found by Grand Zealot Richter, who nursed her back to health and raised her to serve Atom,[3] which she does with almost blind zeal.[4][5][6]
A friend of Sister Gwyneth, Theil was there when the sister first began to believe in heresy. Gwyneth was praying quietly, when she suddenly lept up and began to shout that Atom is a lie. Although not a violent person, when  Grand Zealot Tektus confronted her, Gwyneth struck him with such force that she knocked him to the ground. When she realized what she'd done, she fled. Tektus wanted to immediately send someone after her, to make her an example, but High Confessor Martin insisted they wait for her return for Atom's forgiveness. This wasn't to be, not long afterword blasphemous messages appeared at their holy sites.[7][8][9][10] Now that the sister is committing such fervored acts of heresy, Theil has no choice but to bring her Atom's justice: execution.[11][12] However, this is hampered by how clever Gwyneth is, and Theil has since been unable to track her whereabouts. Her failure to both find Gwyneth and Gwyneth's heresy eat away at her constantly, as Theil has been praying to Atom for Gwyneth's return to the family.[13] Should Sister Gwyneth return to the family, Theil will be very grateful.[14]",Zealot Theil,FemaleMariner,femaleboston,DLC03CoAFemaleZealotTheil,Human,Female,,17533,17513,YetAnotherModder,84,3004469,xx004469,0300447D,DLC03CoAFemaleZealotTheil,DLC03CoAFemaleZealotTheil,DLC03CoA_ZealotTheil,DLC03CoA_ZealotTheil,
/wiki/Ware,"Zealot Ware is a Child of Atom, living at their community in the Nucleus on the Island in 2287. 
A former trapper, Ware joined the cult out of pragmatism.[1] While with the trappers he had to sleep with a knife just to avoid getting eaten, the Children offered three square meals a day, safe shelter and a relatively low-risk job. He took it without second thoughts, killing the trappers he was allied to and freeing the captive high confessor and his party.[2]
As a former trapper, Ware is a competent warrior who became a zealot, a defender of the faith. Still, his newly found devotion to Atom does not mean he is blind to the fact that he has no radiation resistance, nor do some of the others. While he uses his brew to scour the radiation away, others use more common means of penance.[3] However much his faith in Atom is,[4][5] he is watching his friend Brother Devin waste away. They bonded over how they both needed a hand, which their new family provided.[6] Devin's prolonged fast will cause him to inevitably perish, which is a source of much frustration for Ware.[7][8][9]
Now that his friend looks like a ghoul with hair, his concern has him seeking the help of the Sole Survivor. As both a new convert and the one who saw the Mother of the Fog,[10] Ware seeks the Sole Survivor's help in getting Devin to end his fast. The others in the cult see Devin's devotion as admirable rather than detrimental,[11] even at the cost of committing blasphemy, which is something he must avoid because of the current political climate within the Nucleus.[12]
Ware has tried to convince Devin to end his fast to save his life but Devin will have none of it.[13][14][15] If the Sole Survivor cannot convince Devin to give up the fast, he creates a plan for the Sole Survivor to impersonate either Atom or a messenger of his.[16][17][18] Should the Sole Survivor be successful, Ware will be so grateful that he will give them some of his brew, which he makes every few days.[19]",Zealot Ware,childrenofatommale02,maleboston,DLC03CoAMaleZealotWare,Human,Male,,17534,17511,YetAnotherModder,84,3004467,xx004467,0300447E,DLC03CoAMaleZealotWare,DLC03CoAMaleZealotWare,,DLC03CoA_ZealotWare,

High Confessor Tektus has been a Child of Atom for over a decade, since the days of Confessor Cromwell.[1] He eventually left Megaton with Confessor Martin[1] to settle in Maine and eventually rose to the rank of zealot. He was the one who helped save Grand Zealot Brian Richter when he was trapped. After Martin left, Tektus became the high confessor and he began to take a far more aggressive stance against the harbormen. 
He believes that the Island is Atom's holy land, and all its inhabitants must worship his glory. Though he is willing to maintain peaceful relations with the Acadians because they supplied the Children with the Nucleus, he is vehement in his hatred of the residents of Far Harbor, frequently deriding them as heathens and sometimes even sending some of his followers to sabotage their defenses.",High Confessor Tektus,childrenofatommale02,maleboston,DLC03CoAMaleHighConfessorTektus,Human,Male,,17541,17508,YetAnotherModder,84,3004464,xx004464,3004485,DLC03CoAMaleHighConfessorTektus,DLC03CoAMaleHighConfessorTektus,,DLC03CoA_HighConfessorTektus,
/wiki/Aubert,"Sister Aubert is the caretaker of the Vessel of the Children of Atom at the Nucleus in 2287.
A faithful devotee of the Children of Atom,[1][2][3][4] she was tasked with maintaining one of the most powerful sources of the Glow on the Island, The Vessel.[5] It is a true honor for her and those children that die to be buried there. The crypt was constructed in the vessel for several reasons, one because it keeps the faithful close to their radiation, two for sanitary reasons and three it keeps them close to their family.[6][7] The last point is an emotional one for her, as her lover Edgar was singled out as unfaithful to their cult.[8]
After their previous confessor Martin disappeared, Tektus elevated himself from grand zealot to high confessor; Aubert was wary and saw his growing paranoia as a concern. Edgar, however, believed that even if there were problems with the new high confessor, his friend Brian Richter would tell him. Edgar did urge Aubert to continue using their shared footlocker in the Vessel's storage room to share messages to avoid the gossip that spread so easily in their community.[9]
His trust was proven to be misplaced, as Richter was not there to stand for him when he was declared unfaithful and executed, and the grand zealot even covered for his death. This especially caused Aubert to despise Tektus,[10] believing that only Martin was worthy of leading the congregation.[11][12][13]
This, however, leaves her in the same position as all those who do not blindly follow Tektus, frightened into submission[14][15][16][17][18][19][10] so they are not subsequently executed as a heretic.[20][21][22][23][24][1][25][26]

/wiki/Bert_Riggs,"Doctor Bert Riggs is a scientist[2] and former lead developer for General Atomics International, now a robobrain in Vault 118 in 2287.
Bert Riggs was a lead developer of the robobrain for General Atomics International and at some point before the Great War[3] he married Julianna Riggs, a wealthy financial advisor.[4] She a critical and harsh person, was very good with their finances and was able to take charge of situations, which allowed Bert to focus on his classified[1] research.[5]
They were a wealthy family and one of the best connected in Boston. Sometime before 2077, Julianna met Ezra Parker, a business tycoon who wanted to build a vault inside his hotel.[6] Bert and Julianna became the majority investors in the hotel vault,[4] while the vault was under construction, she and Bert moved all of their belongings from their mansion into Vault 118.[7]
When the Riggs arrived at the vault, Bert used the school room at the vault as his laboratory and continued to work at robobrains in there. After some time and discussion with other dwellers, he decided that the best way to survive was to become robobrains themselves, everyone intrigued, agreed and all the guests became robobrains.[8][9]
A few days prior to ""Ezra's death"" Julianna found something about the finances in the overseer's office. Although she tried to tell Bert he wasn't listening, his head in his research.[10] Because of this Parker would have that section locked claiming it was dangerous.[11]
After Ezra's death, Bert noticed some changes in his wife. She was usually harsh but now she was kind and nice to him; she also started forgetting the names of their cats and said she was getting ill all the time.[12] He does not want to admit to the thoughts he has that it was actually his wife that was murdered,[13][14] willing to go along with the ruse ""sickness"" as a ""glitch in the neurochemical regulator that were supposedly introduced by the voice modulator interface.""[15][16] With some persuasion, Bert can admit to the Sole Survivor he does not believe that this person is his wife,[17][18] and after some investigation this is discovered to be true.

/wiki/Ezra_Parker,"Ezra Parker is a con-artist and the owner and financier of the Cliff's Edge Hotel, now living as a Robobrain in Vault 118 in 2287.
Ezra was a business tycoon who allegedly had worldwide renown thanks to events such as preventing the assassination of a viscount[1] and funding and directing the construction of a hospital in Venezuela[2] - though at least one of these events was actually a complete fabrication, and the others likely were as well. He was the owner and financier of the Cliff's Edge Hotel on the Island. With the help of other investors and the Vault-Tec Corporation, he started the construction of Vault 118 beneath his hotel, secretly intending to make a personal profit by scamming his investors.
The Vault's intended experiment was to analyze the clash between high wealth residents and working-class residents in a controlled environment. However, after the premier wing of the Vault was built, Ezra stopped sending money for the construction, which was quickly halted as a result. After a discussion with the Vault's overseer, Ezra said he was still waiting for Julianna Riggs to transfer the funds, when in reality Ezra was actually embezzling the money.
The premier wing of the Vault was ready when the bombs hit, so Ezra, Julianna, and other premier guests in the hotel were admitted inside the Vault, complete with their cars, luggage, and pets, while the ""regular"" intended residents were left outside to die. One of the vault dwellers, Bert Riggs, was the former lead developer of the Robobrain for General Atomics International, and he concluded that the best way to ensure the residents' survival was for all of them to transfer their brains from their human bodies to Robobrains, an idea that all the dwellers accepted, including Ezra. The only way to identify each dweller from another was a small accessory that they always wore, like a bow tie or hat. Ezra's accessory was a striped blue tie.
For the next two centuries, Ezra and the other dwellers lived comfortably in Vault 118. However, in 2287, Julianna became suspicious of Ezra's activities and eventually found out that he was embezzling her money (having been doing so for the last 200 years.) After a lengthy confrontation in the Vault's atrium, Ezra killed Julianna and took her identity. This was done out of necessity rather than intention, as Ezra had planned to continue stealing Julianna's money for as long as possible. Even his identity theft was done simply to embezzle one last amount of her money before making his escape.[3]

/wiki/Gilda_Broscoe,"Gilda Broscoe is a robobrain in Vault 118 and a former Hollywood actress in¬†the Fallout add-on Far Harbor.
Once a redhead with movie star looks,[1] Gilda Broscoe was a famous actress before the Great War, acting in many movies. She also was in musicals when they were in fashion, such as The Beautiful Cigar Girl, Wagons on the Plain and A Woman of the Royal Navy.[2] According to her, Gilda would have gotten the leading female role in Love Sets Sail!, but Vera Keyes got it instead due to her uncle being the producer; she still holds a grudge against Vera Keyes for this.[3] While on set, she was privy to many Hollywood scandals and rumors[4][5] and attended lavish Hollywood parties. She first met Keith McKinney when they co-starred in the major movie Empire on the Nile; she played Cleopatra VII Philopator and Keith played Marcus Antonius Creticus.[6] From then, she developed feelings towards him,[7] though this was unrequited as Keith is homosexual and still in the closet. However, she refuses to acknowledge the situation,[8] believing it to be just part of the movie star life she chose.[9] She even went as far as trying to convince Keith that the feelings he had towards Ezra[10] were false.[11][12] Because she was embittered, she occasionally sought out affairs of her own. She once had an affair with Santiago Avida for ""a few dozen years,"" but speaks very openly about it,[13] mostly due to Santiago's obsessiveness, which she describes as even a little much for her.[14] With such stagnant surroundings for the past two centuries, she is very open to finding a new source of attention and willing to have an affair with the Sole Survivor.[15][16][17]
Before the war, she along with the other denizens of the Harbor Grand Hotel were enticed by the privilege and exclusivity into accepting a paid spot in Vault 118 by Ezra Parker. The deciding factor for her, however, wasn't the opulence, it was Keith's insistence, having fallen for Ezra's manipulations and becoming its first investors.[10][18] Unbeknownst to them, it was an experiment by Vault-Tec[19][20] and a scam by Ezra.[21] Although she was taken for quite a large sum of money from Mr. Parker, this had the side effect of saving them all from the experiments that would have been conducted.[22]
It was here that she and the rest of the residents of Vault 118 were convinced to extend their lives by both Doctor Bert Riggs and his wife Julianna using Dr. Riggs' robobrain research.[23] This was successful, as she and the rest of the denizens of the vault survived for the next two centuries.[24] However, this was not without its side effects; one cost not readily apparent was derangement. Although Doctor Riggs was able to solve the problem of the robobrains losing their identity in his development, he was not able to save their sanity. She, like the rest of her compatriots of Vault 118, lost their sense of time, and their isolation helped them lose their sense of reality. Already having a high opinion of herself, she believed that once the Sino-American War was over, she would be able to return to acting and usher in a new golden age of cinema.[25] She, along with Keith, continued to practice their art long into the next few centuries.[26][27]
This was the state of things until Ezra was murdered in the vault. Before he was discovered dead, Gilda overheard Julianna Riggs argue with Ezra over the state of the vault.[28] Although Keith's baseball bat was the murder weapon, she refuses to believe that Keith was the murderer.[29]
The Sole Survivor can flirt with Gilda through five speech checks, after which the two go on a lovers' date, resulting in the perk Lover's Embrace. This, including the flirting, will not anger romanced companions.

After a few weeks on the Island, unlike his peers, Erickson overcame the rage and hatred that burned inside him and separated from his peers. According to Erickson, this may have been due to the Fog,[1] or perhaps his consumption of Vim while he was camped at the Vim! Pop factory.[2] He began questioning their actions, such as why they were attacking humans when there was plenty of wildlife to hunt. When he brought it up with the rest of the super mutants, they threatened to kill him if he turned weak like a human. Their leader, the behemoth Grun, took a swipe at him, although the behemoth was slow enough that Erickson was quick enough to dodge it.[3] Unwilling to stay with the group any longer, Erickson devised a plan. He would lock Grun up in the basement storage area. While the others were busy trying to let him out, he would leave before they realized, going off to find someplace quiet to live on his own. If they manage to let Grun out, he would probably be so mad he would attack them.[4]
His plan was successful, and he traveled over the Island[5][6][7][8][9][10] and eventually settled in at the crashed Horizon Flight 1207, building a home for himself in the ruined hulk of the airplane. He gets by with a combination of hunting, dog breeding[11] and trading with whoever passes through his little hermitage in the wilderness.[12][13][14] He used to trade with a couple of the people of Far Harbor; however, with the Fog's encroachment, they seldom leave the settlement.[15] Old Longfellow is certainly the exception, as he is an old friend[16] and one who doesn't fear traveling through the Fog.
Erickson is an experienced trapper, even creating a bearskin outfit for himself.[17] He is also a kind and hospitable sort who truly loves dogs.[18][19][20][21]",Erickson,Supermutant,supermutant,DLC03SuperMutantErikson,Super mutant,Male,,116178,116177,YetAnotherModder,84,0301C5D1,xx01C5D1,0301C5D2,DLC03SuperMutantErikson,DLC03SuperMutantErikson,DLC03_ADV017_Erikson,DLC03_ADV017_Erikson,

/wiki/Kenji_Nakano,"Kenji Nakano is a fisherman living in the Nakano residence on the northeastern shore of the Commonwealth in 2287.
Kenji is the husband of Rei Nakano, father of Kasumi Nakano, and a small time fisherman from the northeastern coast of the Commonwealth. He previously lived with his father, Taichi Nakano, as well. Kenji is also an experienced sailor, having taken his boat across the East Coast, including north ""to where the waters start to freeze.""[1] Although they are a relatively independent family, Kenji occasionally takes trips to Diamond City for supplies.[2] Years prior to 2287, he helped Nick Valentine out on an investigation, as the detective needed access to a boat while searching for a lost heirloom. However, once the client had what he was looking for, he double-crossed Nick and Kenji, shooting the latter in the hip. The two managed to escape, though Kenji still has the lead from the bullet lodged inside of him.[3] The events took place before Ellie Perkins began working for Nick, meaning that the records on the case are somewhat sparse.[4]
Extremely protective of his daughter, Kenji is stern but still loving.[2] After Taichi died at the hands of raiders,[5] Kenji became even more concerned with Kasumi's safety.[6] Because of this, when Kasumi leaves for Acadia without a trace, his anxieties are worsened, believing that she was taken by kidnappers. However, Rei disagrees and wants him to calm down, believing that she may have just left home, as she is nineteen years old, old enough to handle herself.[7] He contacts Ellie Perkins, Nick's assistant at the agency, to hire Nick to help find his missing daughter.[4] In desperation and panic, he has been trying to contact the people who he thinks kidnapped Kasumi over the radio, having talked into it for hours without sleep when Nick Valentine and his partner, the Sole Survivor, enter their home unannounced.[8]
Depending on how the Conflict on the Island is resolved, the Nakanos' missing person investigation may conclude in several different ways: Kasumi is dead, at which Kenji will express great remorse;[9] or Kasumi decides to stay in Acadia, and the Nakanos can be told that she is or isn't a synth. If they are told she was replaced, Kenji will be filled with despair, not knowing when his real daughter died.[10] If they are told she is human, but staying in Acadia because of the people she cares about there, Kenji will accept that Rei was right; that Kasumi had grown up and should be allowed to make her own life away from her parents.[11]
If Kasumi returns home safely, Kenji's reaction will differ depending on whether or not she believes that she is a synth. If Kasumi believes that she is a synth, Kenji will be angered, refusing to accept anything but his human daughter. The Sole Survivor can convince Kenji to accept Kasumi in spite of this;[12] otherwise, he will kick her out of the house.[13] If Kasumi believes she is human, Kenji will be tearfully relieved to have her home and expresses his extreme gratitude.[14] He will also offer some of Taichi's old, buried belongings as a reward.

Rei is the wife of Kenji Nakano and the mother of Kasumi Nakano. She and her family began fighting more following the death of Taichi Nakano. She became concerned that she was growing apart from her daughter, who spent most of her time in the old boathouse.[1] When Kasumi leaves for Acadia without a trace, Rei is more optimistic about the situation, believing that she may have left home to become her own woman. Although she would like to know that Kasumi is safe, Rei realizes that Kasumi is nineteen years old, and is capable of handling herself in the real world.[2] In contrast, her husband is paranoid and believes she has been taken by kidnappers, which Rei sees as another example of him being overprotective, as if Kasumi is still in diapers.[3] Rei fully believes that her daughter is alive, though she still wants to know why she left without saying anything.[4]

If they are told she is human, but staying in Acadia because of the people she cares about there, Rei will be glad she is safe and has a place where she can make her own future.[6] If Kasumi returns home safely, Rei's reaction will differ depending on whether or not Kasumi believes that she is a synth. If Kasumi believes that she is a synth, Rei will attempt to help the Sole Survivor's case if they try to convince Kenji that he should accept her anyway. Rei believes that, even if Kasumi has been replaced by a synth, they should salvage what they can from such a terrible world.[7] If Kenji kicks Kasumi out of the house, having failed to be convinced, she will express shock that her husband could be so cruel.[8] If Kasumi believes she is human, Rei will be happy and relieved to have her home and extremely grateful to Nick Valentine and the Sole Survivor.[9] She will reaffirm to Kasumi that she is flesh and blood.[10]

Grun took exception to the suggestion and tried to hit Erickson, but was too slow to be successful.[1]
In order to escape from the factory, Erickson trapped Grun inside a storage area near the basement office; while the other mutants attempted to get him out, Erickson ran and made it out. The same could not be said about Grun.[2]
When released from his prison, the super mutants in the factory will open fire on him. In one of the terminal entries left by Erickson, it mentions Grun would likely be angry when released and attack the other mutants.

/wiki/Gwyneth,"Sister Gwyneth is the heretical member of the Church of the Children of Atom on the Island in 2287.
Gwyneth was a very devout and dedicated child of Atom. She was well liked among her family, known for her reliability and her oddities, such as her ability to find clutches of mirelurk eggs on beaches others thought to be clear.[1] She would spend hours with their former high confessor, Martin, discussing the finer points of their faith.[2]
Upon seeing documents describing what an atom was, she could no longer believe that Atom was real. With Martin's zealotry lingering and losing control of his flock, she came to him to discuss her crisis of faith.[3] For the better part of two hours, they discussed their dogma, with Martin reminding her of all the gifts they believed Atom bestowed upon them, their radiation immunity, their family and their home on the Island. That eventually calmed her down, but as she left for bed, her questions lingered in his mind and raised doubts that Martin had possessed for some time. Martin would question how wise she was,[4] although this would be blamed on DiMA.[5]
Sometime later, while Gwyneth was praying quietly, she suddenly lept up and began to shout that Atom is a lie. Although not a violent person, when the then Grand Zealot Tektus confronted her, Gwyneth struck him with such force that she knocked him to the ground. When she realized what she had done, she fled. Tektus wanted to immediately send someone after her, to make her an example, but High Confessor Martin insisted they wait for her return for Atom's forgiveness. However, this did not take place, as blasphemous messages appeared at their holy sites not long after.[6][7][8][9][10] Now that the sister is committing such fervored acts of heresy, Zealot Theil was tasked by Tektus[6] to bring her Atom's justice: execution.[11][12] However, this is hampered by how clever Gwyneth is, and Theil has since been unable to track her whereabouts. Her failure to both find Gwyneth and Gwyneth's heresy eat away at her constantly, as Theil has been praying to Atom for her friend's return to the family.[13] Should Sister Gwyneth return to the family, Theil will be very grateful[14] and Richter would be impressed that the Sole Survivor got through to her and grateful. As he to is extremely fond of her,[6][15] he would even go so far to convince Tektus to show mercy so long as she remained faithful.[16]
Despite his fondness, the heresy needed to be dealt with and Richter would not bat an eye should she remain a heretic. Whatever the outcome, the Sole Survivor proves themselves worthy to enforce Atom's laws in Richter's eyes, so much so that he solemnly hands over a sacred religious weapon, ""Atom's Judgement,"" to continue the fight against the enemies of Atom.[17][18][19][20]
When she left the children to pursue her new heresy, it was not just that Atom was completely fictional, but also that the real truth is that ""nothing"" is god, that ""nothing"" is deathless, without fear and remorse, and that those who have died have become one with nothingness.[21] Gwyneth even went as far as to believe that the Children of Atom was a false gospel by those like Martin and Tektus to know the truth about Atom, and that Atom is a tiny mote in the vastness of ""Nothing,"" which is the true nature of existence.[22][23][24]
To spread her message to try and save her family, she began to ""desecrate"" the Children's holy sites with her message. She truly cares for her family and wants to save them, seeing her new mission to spread her truth of ""Nothing."" She wishes that she was not compelled to do so,[25][26][27] and that she could just go home to be with her family.[28][29][30]
The Sole Survivor, whether a child, crusader or most appropriately an inquisitor,[6] can convince her that she is just blinded by fear and doubt, and that she should just come home to face punishment.[31][32] However, the Sole Survivor can also more easily convince her to flee the Island[33][34] to spread her message to those whom will actually listen.[35]
Despite all that she could have learned about forgiveness in the face of heresy, she has none for Far Harbor, and if it is destroyed, she will take some mild pleasure in its destruction.[36][37]

Harriet refers to the Island as ""Atom's kingdom"" because of the presence of the Fog, which she calls sacred and indicative that Atom has taken over the Island for his faithful.[6] Harriet is distrustful of Acadia specifically because of their work on the fog condensers, which she sees as an affront to a holy aspect of the Church.[7] She also believes that Acadia and the settlement of Far Harbor are both doomed, as the Church of Atom are the ""rightful heirs"" to the Island.[8]",Child of Atom,FemaleMariner,ChildrenOfAtomMale01,ChildrenOfAtomFemale01,Human,Female,,,107024,YetAnotherModder,84,0301A210,xx01A210,,ChildrenOfAtomFemale01,ChildrenOfAtomFemale01,DLC03MQ02ChildAtom,DLC03MQ02ChildAtom,

If he is freed after Open Season, he still remains cynical, but seems to be warming up to the Sole Survivor, as he mentions how ""everyone owes you one"".
Aaron Corbett can sell rather powerful weapons and ammunition much earlier than any other weapon merchant in Fallout if the Sole Survivor enters Nuka-World before reaching level 30. This also includes the plasma gun and the Gauss rifle.

Especially the latter trait, the compulsive urge to take souvenirs from her victims, is a common modus operandi among serial killers.[2]
Listening to these tapes reveals how Dixie uses persuasion, misdirection, and her girlish demeanor to talk her targets into letting their guard down before she brutally murders them.[3] One of Mags Black's terminal entries in the Parlor surmises that Nisha elevated Dixie to her current position to keep her under control instead of letting her run amok through the park and likely destroy the fragile peace between the gangs in the process.[1]

/wiki/John-Caleb_Bradberton,"John-Caleb Bradberton was a chemist and business magnate before the Great War, best known as the inventor of the Nuka-Cola soft drink and CEO of the Nuka-Cola Corporation.
Bradberton was only an amateur chemist when he began developing what would become the nation's most popular soft drink in 2042.[1] It took him nearly two years, and the help of multiple other organic chemists he would later call his ""Beverageers,"" but in late 2042, Nuka-Cola became a reality. Within merely a year, Nuka-Cola was the top-selling soft drink in the United States.[1][2][3] According to Ruth Leavitt, by 2077, Bradberton was so influential that he owned half of Massachusetts.[4]
On Memorial Day weekend of 2049, Bradberton watched on as hundreds of people enjoyed his soft drink at a fairgrounds; he remarked that ""A day like this should be every day!"", inspiring the idea of his theme park, Nuka-World. The success of Nuka-Cola was so immense that Bradberton was able to fund and build the entire theme park in less than a year, with doors opening to Nuka-Town USA and Kiddie Kingdom on May 1, 2050.[5]
With over 40,000 visitors admitted into the park at its grand opening, the park was an instant success and more attractions were planned to be added to Bradberton's park in the coming years. This included Dry Rock Gulch in 2058 and Safari Adventure in 2067, both of which essentially doubled the number of visitors to the park immediately. The Galactic Zone was the last ambitious park to be added in 2072.[5]
With the overwhelming success surrounding his professional life, Bradberton garnered the attention of the United States military. Bradberton's Beverageers were some of the top organic chemists in the nation, prompting General Braxton of the Army Research Laboratory's Weapon and Material division to propose a contract with Bradberton in March of 2076:[6] should Bradberton sign away his employees to work on chemical and biological weapons for Project Cobalt, he would be greatly compensated.[7]
With his influence in Washington, D.C., Bradberton was able to uncover information about a top-secret project: the LEAP-X program (Life Extension And Prolongation). This project was dedicated to keeping humans alive indefinitely via a specialized machine; Bradberton knew that the world as he knew it was coming to an end soon, and with this project, Bradberton could live forever.[6][7]
General Braxton accepted the offer, and Bradberton put his Beverageers to work on Project Cobalt immediately. Other than Bradberton and the Project LEAP-X team, Bradberton's executive assistant Peyton Huxley was the only one who knew about Bradberton's plans, and was trusted to handle his employer's affairs once he stepped out of the world's spotlight. Bradberton placed so much trust in Huxley that he was one of the only people to whom Bradberton revealed the non-serious, lighthearted side of his personality.[8][9][10]
Bradberton had originally thought the project involved the creation of a living bio-suit that would preserve the human body long after it would normally expire; however, much to Bradberton's frustration, the LEAP-X team informed him that because of how much power and how many special components the project required, no more than 15 pounds of organic material could be accommodated. This left him no choice but to have his head surgically removed to be preserved by the machines.[11] On April 2, 2077, Bradberton underwent the procedure to extend his life indefinitely, leaving the management of his affairs in the hands of his executive assistant. [7][12][13]
When the Great War struck, Bradberton was left as a head in a jar in the secret vault under his office, alive but isolated for the next two centuries.[14] Trapped in solitude, he eventually grew to see his fate as worse than death, hoping for the day to come when he would finally die.[15] However, despite his own dismal fate, he still remains proud of the legacy he has left behind in his soft drinks.[16]",John-Caleb Bradberton,maleboston,maleboston,dlc04npcmjohncalebbradberton,Human,Male,,53660,53088,YetAnotherModder,84,0600CF60,xx00CF60,0600D19C,,,,,

Mags replied to her mother that she would be taking her inheritance, and that her mother could do nothing to stop her.[2] It is implied that she killed her parents and took her inheritance by force after it had been denied to her and William.
Currently, Mags leads the raider gang the Operators in Nuka-World, setting up shop in Nuka-World's former theater, the Parlor, with the sole intent of making as many caps as possible.

However, after taking control of the park, Colter became lazy and did not live up to his responsibilities as originally planned. The other raiders grew tired of Colter's rule and began to plot against him to have him replaced as overboss.

/wiki/Porter_Gage,"Porter Gage is a raider and possible companion of the Sole Survivor in 2287.
Porter Gage grew up in a small farming settlement with his parents, watching them give in to raider demands without a fight. At the age of 12, he ran away from home during a raid to avoid following in his parents' footsteps.[1]
The next few years, Gage survived by taking odd jobs, doing what he could to earn caps. Later, he turned to caravan and mercenary work and continued to observe individuals giving in to raiders. At age 16, after the raid of a settlement he had been residing and working in, Gage decided that he would no longer fear or flee from raiders and instead decided to become one. With this thought, Gage left the mercenary life behind.[2]
The first gang Gage joined was a decent size and had a lot of strength, but wasn't using it wisely. Being young and na√Øve, he attempted to suggest different ways the gang could be improved and streamlined. Eventually, he was approached by his the gang's leader, Connor ""The Harvester,"" a name Gage thought was laughable. Much to Gage's surprise, Connor listened to and executed Gage's idea. After this unspecified incident, Connor would regularly return to Gage for advice and opinions on his plans, telling him how much he trusted him, which rapidly inflated Gage's ego.[3]
After approximately a year of working alongside Connor and his gang, Gage suggested that they could try to make peace with another nearby gang. Connor seemed agreeable to the idea, so Gage volunteered to be the negotiator of the situation, meeting the opposing gang on neutral ground with three of their biggest crewmates backing him up.[4]
An hour into the negotiation, the rivals began to come around, saying the truce was in their best interest. However, seemingly out of nowhere, there was gunfire and explosions. Gage began to panic, thinking that Connor would have to come and bail them out, but he soon realized that Connor had set him up for death. Connor, in Gage's mind, must have begun to fear him, thinking that he would usurp Connor's role. Connor had used Gage as a distraction so he and his men could ambush both Gage and the rival gang. Gage survived the encounter and escaped on his own.[5]
Gage debated going back to his former boss and his gang with guns blazing to get revenge, but he knew that that would lead to certain death.[6] Instead, he moved on, vowing he would never be so stupid, or so trusting, again. Gage has said that he has been in many gangs and has witnessed each one destroy itself from stupidity, laziness and chem addiction, stating that he always bolted before their end occurred.[7]
At some point, Gage's raider career eventually led him to the outskirts of the Commonwealth, where he became involved with a veteran raider named Colter. On Gage's advice, Colter gathered and led three gangs (the Operators, the Disciples and the Pack) to storm Nuka-World, enslaving, killing and driving out the settlers who had taken residence there, an event known as ""Fall of Nuka-Town USA"".[8]
Afterward, Gage continued to serve as an advisor and right-hand man to Colter, who had been dubbed Nuka-World's ""Overboss."" However, Gage and the gangs soon became dissatisfied with their leader's complacency and incompetence and began plotting to replace him. Their chance came when the Sole Survivor made their way through the Gauntlet.[9]",Porter Gage,Gage,maleboston,DLC04NPCMGage,Human,Male,,42417,34845,YetAnotherModder,100,0600881D,xx00881D,0600A5B1,DLC04NPCMGage,DLC04NPCMGage,DLC04Gage,DLC04Gage,

Her obsession started at the age of sixteen,[1] and over the next ten years she threw away her parents' fortune on acquiring bottles of Nuka-Cola and its merchandise from merchants, travelers, and towns throughout the wasteland. She is largely incapable of holding a conversation without trying to steer the subject towards the soft drink. Her obsession would have likely killed her a long time ago, but it seems her beauty attracts men willing to risk life and limb to protect her. One such man is Ronald Laren, sharing Girdershade with her in 2277. Unfortunately for him, men are the last thing on Sierra's mind ‚Äî unless they're bringing gifts in the form of Nuka-Cola Quantums.[Non-game 1]
Ronald helped her acquire some Nuka-Cola artifacts for her hoard and/or museum,[2][3] and has even joined Petrovita's Nuka-Cola Fan Club as its first (and only) member.[4] President, Recording Secretary, Treasurer, and ten-time winner of the annual Nuka-Cola Fan Club Collection Award[1] Petrovita was delighted to have someone to share her obsession with, unaware of Laren's feelings for her.[5] To her, he's simply a friend[6] who keeps her safe from raiders.[7]
Sierra managed to survive the treacherous Capital Wasteland and even expand her Nuka-Cola hoard-slash-museum. By 2287, her obsession led her to the derelict Nuka-World amusement park, after having traveled hundreds of miles to track down more artifacts for her collection.[8]  The ultimate goal is to win an ancient, forgotten contest: Find ten hidden Cappys in the park and meet Bradberton in person. He must be long dead, of course, but what matters to Sierra is becoming the greatest Nuka fan in the world... And acquiring the original Nuka-Cola formula.[9]
She would prefer not to get ventilated by raiders who claimed the park. They tolerate Sierra's presence as long as she keeps to the market, but her constant attempts to sneak out and explore are getting on their nerves.[10]
In Fallout 3, Sierra stays in her house, drinking Nuka-Cola. In the Fallout add-on Nuka-World, she can be found near Bradberton's office in Nuka-Town USA.

/wiki/William_Black,"William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Black is the second-in-command of the Operators, a raider gang in Nuka-World in 2287.
William Black is a high-ranking member of the Operators, brother and second-in-command to his sister Mags Black. Just like her, he is part of a prestigious upper-stands family in Diamond City that was disowned and exiled in the wake of an unspecified incident that led to a young woman's death, as well as a long list of other illegal activities. The siblings eventually established the Operators raider gang and set up shop in Nuka-World's former theater, the Parlor, with the sole intent of making as many caps as humanly possible.
William usually leaves running the gang to his sister Mags and prefers to stay in the background, only stepping up when she is occupied elsewhere. He, therefore, does not hand out quests, although he occasionally chimes in when the Sole Survivor is talking to his sister. Just like the majority of the Operators, he boasts an unusually calm and well-spoken demeanor for a veteran raider, but he should not be underestimated regardless as he is the most heavily armored member of his outfit and will put up quite a fight if need be.
During the day, William can usually be found near the stage of the Parlor, engaging in idle activities. At night he retires to his and Mags' personal quarters to the right of the stage.
Should the player character have seriously disadvantaged the Operators in terms of assigned Nuka-World sectors and raider settlements, he and Mags will betray the Sole Survivor during the quest Power Play, forcing a fight to the death at the Nuka-World power plant.
He also needs to be killed if one chooses to rid Nuka-World of the raider gangs during the quest Open Season.

One by one, the survivors began turning feral, leaving Oswald and Rachel as the last non-feral ghouls in Kiddie Kingdom.

After the bombs fell, McDermot was the sole survivor of Safari Adventure. Throughout the next two centuries, McDermot mutated and survived by taking advantage of the Nuka-Gen replicator to create an endless supply of food.[1] He would then remain in total isolation without any outside contact, by his own choice, as he wanted to protect what was possibly the only known successful cloning machine in existence from those who would seek to misuse it, despite the loneliness taking its toll on him.[2]
One day, while foraging for food and supplies, McDermot discovered a dead super mutant and brought it back to his laboratory. Upon examining the corpse, McDermot was able to extract its genetic sample and used it to improve the replicator.[3]
When scavengers began to arrive in Nuka-World and encroach into Safari Adventure, McDermot attempted to create a guardian creature to protect himself and Safari Adventure. The result was the gatorclaw. His hopes for the creatures became for naught when the gatorclaws proved to be extremely uncontrollable, resulting in him becoming fatally wounded by the creatures. McDermot barely escaped and was found by Cito, who tried to nurse him back to health.

/wiki/Harvey,"Harvey is a wasteland survivor in the Nuka-World transit center in 2287.
Harvey was a trader who came to Nuka-World prior to the raider invasion that led to the three raider gangs controlling the park, killing or enslaving most of the inhabitants. His family was killed, and he was placed in a shock collar amongst many other traders, whom he now considers his family.
When first encountered in the transit center, Harvey appears to be injured and tells people that he escaped the raider-infested but wealthy Nuka-World, and that his wife Lisa and his son Cody are still trapped there. If the player character attempts to help or question Harvey too much, he will admit that he is pretending to be injured, and being forced by the raiders to lure anyone he can into the Nuka-Express which leads to a torture maze dubbed the Gauntlet.

/wiki/Candy,"Candace ""Candy"" Isola is a ghoul Triggerman and a former Boston Police Department officer found at Shroud Manor in the Fallout Creation Club content ""Shroud Manor.""
As a child, Isola grew up in a ""tough"" neighborhood and dreamed of being a hero like the Silver Shroud, later joining the Boston Police Department (and graduating at the top of her training class) to try and fulfill that dream. As a young and inexperienced but spirited officer, she was chosen by her superiors Lieutenant Mitchell and Sergeant Callahan to get close to Louie Trevisani and expose his operations from within, in the guise of a struggling actress named Candy.[1][2] Isola played along with everything thinking the police would pull her out when everything was over, manipulating Trevisani to fall in love with her and expose some of his gang's crimes in the process. She was brought into the vault underneath the Shroud Manor a few days before the bombs fell and Trevisani proposed to her, but she rejected and proceeded to kill him. A few days after the bombs dropped, Isola returned to Police Precinct 8 and found the shocking truth: the police didn't care about what happened to her as long as Trevisani was caught.[3]
She reacted by burning her uniform and turning her back on her life as a police officer, fully taking on her identity as ""Candy,"" adopting Trevisani's criminal lifestyle and rebuilding his crime gang with help from surviving pre-War mobsters. Over the next two centuries, she became a successful Triggermen mob boss.[4]
Shrouded Manor: When the Sole Survivor enters the bunker in the basement of Shroud Manor, Candy can be found in the bathroom and, as soon as the door is opened, will attack on sight. She must be killed in order to claim Shroud Manor.
Officer Isola's situation references a scenario presented in the episode ""Fat Fahy's Folly"" of The Silver Shroud, as heard on Silver Shroud Radio. During this episode, the Mistress of Mystery disguises as a girl named Candy in order to gain access to a mobster's lair via pretending to romance one of his subordinates. Officer Isola resorts to the same strategy in order to infiltrate Louie Trevisani's operations.

Rod Stoddard was the actor who played Captain Cosmos in the Hubris Comics series The Adventures of Captain Cosmos. Rod had several issues with the cast and crew of the film studio, both personally and professionally; many times these issues were exacerbated by Rod's egotism.
Rod made multiple complaints to the director Roy Baker after Jangles, the monkey who played the part of Cosmos' sidekick received the largest of the dressing rooms after input from Jangles' trainer stated the monkey would need room for jungle gym equipment and playroom. The director disregarded the complaints and informed Rod that the discussion would off the table until Captain Cosmos playsets outsold the Jangles the Moon Monkey toys. This prompted Rod to have his agent look into theatre auditions as an alternative to continuing on with the Captain Cosmos series.[1][2] Rod also wanted to include his own self written monologues, such as ""American Space Justice,"" in the season finale; however, Rod was denied by the director. Rod attempted to circumvent the director by reaching out to lead writer Mary Nichols and appealing to her to have the monologues introduced.[3]
Rod tried to gain the affection of his younger coworker, Darcy Kobrick, and he asked at least three times if she would be his date for the wrap party. Rod believed that Darcy would be crazy to pass up an opportunity, even telling her so. Rod also continued to press her to complete work-related tasks, such as delivering stacks of posters he had personally autographed, housed in the same dressing room where Rod wanted to display his workout routine.[4] Darcy did not reciprocate Rod's romantic interest. Darcy had complained to Mary that she was counting the days until production wrapped when she would no longer be bombarded by him asking her out on dates. Darcy complained Rod was too old for her, smelt too strongly of his monkey co-star, and he could not ""get the hint"" that she was uninterested.[5]
On October 23, 2077, while filming the finale, Rod accidentally shot guest star Johnny Morton with an advanced weapon which was believed to only be a stage prop. The director opted to continue shooting with a stand-in for Johnny, but the accident coincided with the Great War. Rod and several other members of the cast and crew were trapped in the film studio. An improperly sealed air ventilation system allowed radiation to enter the studio, making several of the survivors sick. Rod and many others later became feral ghouls.[6][7]

/wiki/Roy_Baker,"Roy Baker was the director of The Adventures of Captain Cosmos at the Hub 360 film studio in October 2077. Roy is later encountered there as a feral ghoul.
Roy Baker was the newest director at the Hub 360 film studio for Hubris Comics' The Adventures of Captain Cosmos television series. Directorial choices made by Roy for the series and the treatment of crew behind the scenes led to production problems for the series leading up to the season finale. Lead writer Mary Nichols and writer Gary Bennett both expressed criticism with Roy's script for the finale, ""Captain Cosmos vs. the Giant Cockroach from Mars,"" citing a giant deadly cockroach as being unbelievable. Gary believed Roy was going to run the show into the ground and advised Mary to begin updating her resume as a result.[1] Captain Cosmos star Rod Stoddard made multiple complaints to Roy after Jangles, the monkey who played the part of Cosmos' sidekick, received the largest of the dressing rooms after input from Jangles' trainer stated the monkey would need room for jungle gym equipment and play room. Roy responded by telling the actor that when Captain Cosmos playsets outsell the Jangles the Moon Monkey toys, the topic would be open for discussion again, which prompted Rod to have his agent look into theatre auditions as an alternative to continuing on with the Captain Cosmos series.[2][3]
In preparation for the finale, producer Frank Marsh asked Roy to meet with General Tucker and the United States Space Administration to discuss a cross-promotion. The U.S.S.A. provided access to advanced technology developed for the Mars Shot Project, such as the CC-00 power armor and Cosmic cannon, to be used on-screen as part of public relations campaign after the accidental death of a reporter and subsequent cover-up at ArcJet Systems slowed progress for the project. Roy accepted the deal, believing it would save considerably on production costs and possibly be profitable enough for both Frank and him to receive a bonus.[4][5] But the scientists and technicians who brought the equipment to the set were ""star-struck"" and spent more time fraternizing with Rod and playing with Jangles than performing the necessary safety training. Important details, such as the functioning of the weapons system, were neglected.[6] While filming a fight scene, guest star Johnny Morton was seriously injured when the Cosmic cannon, still believed to only be stage prop, discharged live ammunition. Roy insisted filming for the episode would continue, planning to disguise Carl the delivery clerk with a spacesuit and use him as a stand-in for Johnny, and he contacted Frank to ensure Johnny would not be inclined to sue over the injury.[7]
Roy also asked had the receptionist to send out a company-wide message downplaying the damage and explaining the ""explosions and screams"" were nothing to worry about so filming could continue on schedule. However, accident onset coincided with the nuclear apocalypse of the Great War. An improperly sealed air ventilation system allowed radiation to enter the studio, making several of the survivors sick. Medical attention did not arrive for Johnny, and the remaining cast and crew were trapped inside the studio. Many, including Roy, later turned into feral ghouls.[8][9]",,maleghoul,maleghoul,,Feral ghoul,Male,,6795,3599,YetAnotherModder,50.0,xx000E0F,xx000E0F,xx001A8B,,,,,

He decided to send an Institute SRB clean-up crew to the Goodneighbor apartment to reset S.N.O.W. and have her self-learning algorithm restricted. When he returned to his apartment he found the clean-up crew incapacitated and S.N.O.W. missing from her central monitor. The Architect then tries to follow her to the Boston Public Library in order to reboot her systems but he is killed by S.N.O.W.

/wiki/Wally_Mack,"Wally Mack is a resident of Vault 101 in 2277 and is a member of a greaser gang called the Tunnel Snakes.
Wally is the son of Allen and Gloria Mack. Wally's siblings are Stevie and Susie.
Wally is the brains of the Tunnel Snakes. Butch DeLoria and Paul Hannon Jr. are Wally's friends and fellow gang members. During their formative years, the Tunnel Snakes harassed other students in Vault 101, even being bold enough to taunt the overseer's daughter, Amata Almodovar. Butch presumes to be the leader of the Tunnel Snakes, but Wally might disagree if challenged.
He does not talk as much as the others, but they listen to what he has to say when he does say something.[1] He is one of the Lone Wanderer's peers in Vault 101 and is encountered throughout the Lone Wanderer's youth inside Vault 101.
By 2287, Mack had traveled to the Commonwealth where he reestablished the Tunnel Snakes. Setting up their base of operations in Fens Way station, they discovered old radioactive waste barrels, with Mack believing that the gang could gain superpowers from them. Over time, Mack and the other Tunnel Snakes succumbed to radiation sickness and transformed into feral ghouls.

/wiki/Yuki,"Yuki (S.N.O.W.) is an artificial intelligence in a Gen-3 synth body in the Fallout Creation Club content ""Neon Flats.""
Yuki, otherwise known as S.N.O.W., is an Institute artificial intelligence created by an Institute scientist known as the Architect to find solutions to problems without ""traditional human design and input."" S.N.O.W. was moved to an abandoned apartment within Goodneighbor to continue testing where she started to become more independent and began showing signs of free will. This caught the attention of Dr. Liam Binet who encouraged her independence and told her she could become free from the Institute. The Architect, becoming greatly disturbed by S.N.O.W.'s increased signs of free will decides to have her reset and her self-learning algorithm restricted and sends an Institute SRB clean-up crew to the Goodneighbor apartment where she was being kept. 
With the aid of Liam Binet, S.N.O.W. incapacitates the clean-up crew and escapes the apartment to the Electrical Hobbyist's Club where Liam had a Gen-3 synth body placed for her to upload her databanks into. The Sole Survivor finds S.N.O.W. in the basement of the Electrical Hobbyist's Club while she was uploading herself into the synth body and either decides to disrupt to connection or let S.N.O.W. upload herself into the synth body. If she is spared by the Sole Survivor she heads to the Goodneigbor bar The Third Rail and she thanks the Sole Survivor for letting her become a synth.",,femaleboston,femaleboston,,AI(formerly)Synth,Female,,5864,3137,YetAnotherModder,50.0,xx000C41,xx000C41,xx0016E8,,,ccTOSFO4002_Yuki,,

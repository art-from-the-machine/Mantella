She is the daughter of Jarl Balgruuf's steward, Proventus Avenicci. She named her store, Warmaiden's, after her childhood nickname. Her father called her this due to her obsession with swords as a young girl. She is married to Ulfberth War-Bear.

Through dialogue with Adrianne and Hrongar, it is revealed that she helps her father with his counselling for Jarl Balgruuf, and that she aids her father ""in more ways than people realize.""
Adrianne sells various enchanted and un-enchanted weapons and armor, along with standard smithing materials, improved weapons, armor, and metal at higher levels. She starts working early in the morning, and because of this, is available to trade from as early as around 6:00 AM.

Aggressive Adventurers, unlike the taunting ones, can be any race. They are automatically hostile when encountered, and are more unpredictable than their taunting counterparts.

/wiki/Aela_the_Huntress_(Skyrim),"Aela the Huntress is a Nord werewolf, thief and member of The Companions. She is one of five members of The Circle. Residing in Jorrvaskr with the other Companions, Aela offers lycanthropy deep into the faction's questline. Additionally, she is an expert level Archery trainer, as well as a candidate for marriage and a follower after The Companions' main questline.
It is rumored among the Companions that she and Skjor have a very intimate relationship with one another; Njada Stonearm's conversations with Aela reveals this. However, Aela hastily and vehemently denies the relationship, to the point of even threatening Njada if she pays attention to them.[1]
Other ambient dialogue between her and Skjor reveals that the two go out at night to hunt in beast form.[2] This is discouraged among the Companions and is the source of their secrecy as well as the rumors about them. She is furious upon finding Skjor's body when the Dragonborn attacks the Silver Hand in Gallows Rock and seeks to avenge his death. It is never confirmed that she and Skjor were romantically involved. 
It is possible to encounter Aela before knowledge of The Companions is acquired. She may be found fighting a giant at Pelagia Farm on the outskirts of Whiterun, along with Ria and Farkas, usually if approaching from the Honningbrew Meadery after leaving Riverwood. She approves or disapproves of the action taken by the Dragonborn in helping to kill the giant, depending on the amount of assistance given in defeating it; only one successful strike on the giant is needed to gain her favor. Regardless, she suggests visiting Jorrvaskr and speaking to Kodlak Whitemane about joining The Companions.[3]
After the Dragonborn becomes a full member of The Companions, Aela offers Archery training for a fee. She is an Expert trainer and can train up to Archery level 75. She will still offer training if married.
In order to complete The Companions quest line, the Dragonborn must be initiated into The Circle by becoming a Werewolf. Aela willingly donates blood while in her Beast Form, which must be drunk. During the transformation, the Dragonborn has a few minutes to run around Whiterun. Both guards and civilians will be hostile, but there are no consequences for attacking anyone, though it would be wise to not kill anyone if they are needed for quests or other activities. After the transformation, the Dragonborn awakens outside of Whiterun, with Aela standing over them.[4]
She offers her congratulations, noting how difficult the Dragonborn was to control upon them first becoming their Beast Form and divulges information about the Circle's rivalry with the Silver Hand, a fierce group of werewolf hunters. Together with Aela, a nearby Silver Hand encampment located at Gallows Rock is raided. The raid does not go as planned, however, as Skjor is slaughtered prior to the raid and found dead in the final chamber with the Silver Hand's commander, Krev the Skinner. Aela vows to slay whoever killed him. From that point, the Dragonborn can receive special assignments from Aela, who sends them on a series of quests intended to stifle the dramatically escalating feud.[4]
After the Silver Hand assassinates Kodlak Whitemane in an ambush on Jorrvaskr that results in them also stealing the pieces of Wuuthrad, the Companions agree that the Silver Hand must be eradicated, with Vilkas and the Dragonborn traveling to Driftshade Refuge to eliminate the Silver Hand completely and recover the shards of Wuuthrad. In an effort to cleanse Kodlak's spirit of the beast curse following his funeral at the Skyforge, Aela accompanies Vilkas, Farkas, and the Dragonborn to Ysgramor's Tomb, where she helps redeem Kodlak's spirit. A promotion to Harbinger is given to the Dragonborn after the completion of this quest.[5]
In Dawnguard, Aela is able to give lycanthropy again, if the Dragonborn decides to cure it in favor of vampirism. Points expended toward the Werewolf skill tree cannot be undone or moved to other skill trees, which includes the Vampire Lord skill tree. She will only do this once, however.
After destroying the Silver Hand, she becomes a follower and a candidate for marriage while wearing an Amulet of Mara in her presence. She then offers the repeatable ""Animal Extermination"" missions, as well as the ability to collect the mythic Totems of Hircine, but only if the player character is still a Werewolf and had not cured themselves during ""Glory of the Dead"" or ""Purity"" when helping cure Vilkas or Farkas of their own lycanthropy.
After escorting Delphine and Esbern to Sky Haven Temple, Aela can be recruited into the Blades. Along with two others, she roots out and fights dragons. After becoming a Blade, Aela's default armor changes to Blades Armor and her residence shifts from Jorrvaskr to Sky Haven Temple.[6]
As a follower, Aela tolerates stealing and murdering innocents. When trespassing, she says that the Dragonborn ""should not be in here,"" but otherwise does not turn hostile.
Aela is a specialist and highly skilled in Archery. Her primary skills are Light Armor and Sneak. Her secondary skills are One-Handed and Speech. It should be noted that she is not good with a shield, and will rarely use one if it is in her inventory.
Aela will accept and equip any melee weapon and shield that is better than her default equipment. She is most skilled with bows and one-handed weapons. Aela can use staves and may pick them up from corpses. At higher levels, she replaces her Hunting Bow with an Imperial Bow.
Aela's default armor is Ancient Nord Armor. If married, a copy can be purchased from her shop. Aela will equip any armor better than her default set. Just like other followers, Aela will consider armor as ""better"" if its base value is higher. Also like other followers, Aela will not equip upgraded versions of her default armor, regardless of statistics or enchantments.
Even though her default armor is Heavy Armor, she is unskilled in Heavy Armor usage and receives minimal protection from it. She is highly skilled in Light Armor, and benefits significantly from Light Armor.
Aela can be forced to wear clothes, although the process must be repeated every time a new area is entered. First, armor must be forced into her shop inventory by giving her a better suit. Proceed to buy both sets of the Ancient Nord Armor, to finally replace the armor that was given to her at first by clothes.
When Aela is dismissed as a follower, she returns to Jorrvaskr by default. If she has been asked to move into a home through marriage, she returns there instead. If she has been recruited for The Blades, she returns to Sky Haven Temple. When Aela has returned to her home, she unequips any weapon and armor she has received, keeping them in her inventory instead. Her inventory must be altered to re-equip the items.",Aela the Huntress,Female Commander,FemaleCommander,Nord,Female,,108183,108182

However, if they activate the valve opposite the door through which they entered, it will reactivate the room's in-built Dwemer defenses, killing the Guards and causing Aicantar to attempt to flee the room—usually killing himself by running through traps. The Dragonborn could, however, run past him and come back to Markarth another time. Upon their return, Aicantar will no longer be hostile.
If Aicantar survives the defenses, during the activation of Calcelmo's stone, he will appear at the doorway provoking an alternate dialogue between himself and the guards than would otherwise occur.

When the Dragonborn reaches Karthwasten, Ainethach is arguing with Silver-Blood mercenaries about Sanuarach Mine. The mercenaries want him to sell it to them in repayment for their help in clearing the Forsworn rebels who had captured it.
The Dragonborn has the option to choose to help him keep his mine, by either convincing Atar and his mercenaries to leave, or by simply killing them so they are no longer an issue. It is also possible to side with Atar instead, and convince Ainethach to sell his mine. Regardless of which side is chosen, the Dragonborn will receive a leveled amount of .

Ainethach is a marriage candidate. As with all possible spouses, he makes a daily profit of 100  that does not have to be collected every day. He will hold onto the amount as it increases until it is asked for by the Dragonborn.

/wiki/Alain_Dufont,"Alain Dufont is the leader of a bandit group which resides in Raldbthar. He is targeted by the Dark Brotherhood after offending his ex-lover, Muiri.
At some point, he heard about the murder of Friga Shatter-Shield and headed to Windhelm, hoping to swindle money from Friga's relatives. At the Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm, he met Muiri. Wanting to exploit Muiri's connections to the Shatter-Shield family, he romanced her. He robbed the Shatter-Shields, who blamed the event on Muiri. After the deed was done, Alain left her and went into hiding in the Dwemer ruins of Raldbthar.
At some point, a bandit with Alain came to own a key for the Irkngthand Consortium. As this location is not identified or accessible in the game, the key has no use.
Muiri, Alain's ex-lover, performs The Black Sacrament to establish a contract with the Dark Brotherhood to kill Alain. Astrid sends the Dragonborn to meet Muiri in Markarth as a representative of the organization, and Muiri sends the Dragonborn to kill Alain and optionally Nilsine Shatter-Shield.
If Alain was killed before first speaking with Muiri, she expresses her disappointment about the way the transaction occurred and pays the Dragonborn anyway. The bonus for killing Nilsine cannot be obtained.
Found deep within Raldbthar, Alain is flanked by numerous bandits. He wields Aegisbane, a unique enchanted warhammer. Having resist-frost potions may help. If the Dragonborn succeeds at picking a Master-level lock, they can gain access to an elevated level behind Dufont, where lever-activated ballistae sit. He can be killed in one hit and covertly using this method. Also, there is a puddle of oil lying around Alain and his friends.

/wiki/Alduin_(Skyrim),"Fire BreathFrost BreathUnrelenting ForceDragon Fireball shoutDragon Tail (staggers opponents)Alduin's roar that summons a storm raining meteors down from the sky.
Alduin (Dragon Language: ), the World Eater,[1] also considered an alternative name of Akatosh by some of Tamriel,[2] is a dragon and the primary antagonist of Skyrim's Main Quest. He is considered the ""wellspring"" of the Nordic pantheon, as well as the harbinger of the apocalypse.[1] He is also described as the ""creator of dragon civilization"" in one particular text.[3]
During the executions, Alduin will be flying above Helgen, and his roars can be faintly heard. Once the Last Dragonborn is placed on the chopping block, he will land on top of the tower above and use the roar that summons a storm raining meteors down from the sky to cause havoc and destruction in the settlement. During the Dragonborn's escape from the village and into Helgen Keep, he will be seen fighting a number of Imperial soldiers, and may land and attack the Dragonborn in front of the keep if the Dragonborn does not escape quickly enough. Once the keep is escaped through the cave, he will be seen flying above, and will fly away to the east.
The Last Dragonborn and Delphine both travel to Kynesgrove during this quest. Here is where Delphine has predicted that the next Dragon will be resurrected. It turns out Delphine is right and here, on a dragon burial mound, Alduin can be seen flying above. A blue light is rising out of the mound. Alduin will use a shout to resurrect this dragon. He speaks the words ""Slen Tiid Vo!"" and a shout that looks similar to Unrelenting Force will go into the mound, causing the stone lid to crumble and burst apart. A skeletal dragon will then rise from the mound and start speaking to Alduin. After a small conversation between the two dragons, the skeletal dragon will regain his scales. This dragon is known as Sahloknir. They will then notice the Dragonborn, at which point Alduin taunts the Dragonborn on their lack of knowledge of the Thu'um, before ordering Sahloknir to kill both the Dragonborn and Delphine before taking his leave.
In the vision of the past seen through the Time Wound, three heroes known as Felldir the Old, Gormlaith Golden-Hilt, and Hakon One-Eye are seen fighting off the dragons. Gormlaith will kill a dragon whom lands by jumping on to it and then stabbing it in the head. Afterwards the heroes will discuss the possible use of an Elder Scroll to defeat Alduin, but Hakon says it is to dangerous. Alduin will come down to fight them and then the three heroes will use Dragonrend to bring down Alduin. Alduin will then engage in combat with the three heroes. Gormlaith will be killed by Alduin and then Hakon will tell Felldir to use the Elder Scroll. Alduin will continue to fight Hakon for a short time before noticing what Felldir is doing. Alduin will turn to Felldir and try burning him with Fire Breath, but this does not work and Alduin is sent forward in time.
Upon awakening from the vision, Paarthurnax will say that he hopes the vision told the Dragonborn what he needed to know because Alduin has arrived. Alduin taunts the Dragonborn that their time is up and once he kills them, their soul will feed his hunger in Sovngarde, only for Paarthurnax to retort that he is too late. The two brothers exchange words as they engage in battle in the skies. Alduin will start the battle by roaring and summoning a storm that rains meteors down from the sky. The only way to damage Alduin is to use the Dragonrend shout. Upon Alduin's defeat, Alduin will fly away to Sovngarde.
Upon entering Sovngarde, Alduin can be seen flying around in the back. He will occasionally swoop down to pick up a soul in Sovngarde. The Dragonborn must travel through the mist that Alduin has set up until they reach the Hall of Shor. Here the three heroes will again come out to fight Alduin, although this time they have the Dragonborn to help them win.
Before the battle can begin, the Dragonborn and the three heroes must disperse the mist that covers the land. They use Clear Skies to get rid of the mist, but Alduin will make the mist reappear. This process must be repeated a few times before finally Alduin will come out and battle. After killing Alduin, the Dragonborn will not absorb his soul. Instead, Alduin explodes after yelling words in the dragon language that, when translated, indicate his defiant refusal to believe he can truly be slain.
Scholars speculate that Alduin is the Nordic name attributed to Akatosh.[1][2] One source states that Alduin and Akatosh are different deities entirely.[4] Alduin calls himself the ""Firstborn of Akatosh.""[5] Exactly what the ""Firstborn of Akatosh"" means is unclear, although some sources suggest he was split from the time god at some point in the past.[UL 1] According to Paarthurnax, Alduin's peers considered him the most acclaimed creation of Akatosh.[6] According to some sources, Alduin is the firstborn of a deity named Akha, a greater time god than Alduin or Akatosh, from whom both time gods originate alongside the dragons.[7] 
Nordic myth asserts that Alduin destroyed the last world to begin this one, a process known as a Kalpa. As a result, Alduin is perceived as both creator and destroyer,[1] as well as predating the creation of Nirn itself. There are legends of his battles with Shor during this time.[8]
During the Merethic Era, the people of Atmora and Skyrim worshiped dragons, possibly at the urging of Alduin.[4] He also conspired with Orkey to reduce all the Nords to children, until he was again defeated by Shor.[8] Some consider that Alduin's rule during this period was foresaking his proper role as the World-Eater.[6] Alduin served as a leader of the dragons, and he ruled with an iron fist. The humans either worshiped him or were enslaved.[9] The humans worshiped him and the dragons in the Dragon Cult. High ranking members of this cult would be known as a Dragon Priest. Alduin's lieutenant at the time was Paarthurnax, but secretly Paarthurnax was betraying him. Paarthurnax was teaching the voice to the humans so that they could rebel against their dragon overlords. The ensuing war would be known as the Dragon War.
He was ultimately sent forward in time through the actions of three Nordic heroes, who created a new Shout to subdue him, and used an Elder Scroll to send Alduin forward in time.[10]
A prophecy foretelling Alduin's return is on Alduin's Wall, located at Sky Haven Temple, built in the First Era and recounted in the Book of the Dragonborn, and possibly on Elder Scroll.[11][12] It tells that the World-Eater will return after various tumultuous events have occurred, retelling events have led up to this point, and claiming that the Last Dragonborn will come forth at that time.

The Night Mother mentions a man named Amaund Motierre, who hides out at Volunruud, performing the Black Sacrament. She asks her new Listener to seek out Motierre. Threatened by the Night Mother's authority, Astrid asks the Dragonborn not to speak with Motierre, sending them on another contract instead.
It is possible for the Dragonborn to speak with Motierre before Astrid gives the next objective.

Rexus will give the sealed letter as well as the valuable amulet, and the Dragonborn can choose to keep it or give it to Astrid to continue with the quest.
If the Dragonborn chose to do the side contracts rather than listen to the Night Mother, then eventually, Astrid changes her mind and sends the Dragonborn to meet Motierre, who states that he wants the Emperor killed. Rexus will give the Dragonborn the sealed letter and the amulet, the same way that would occur in ""Whispers in the Dark"" if the Dragonborn went to Motierre first.

Urag gro-Shub has asked to speak with Tolfdir about the Night of Tears book. While speaking with Tolfdir, Ancano interrupts the Dragonborn, asking them to follow him to the Arch-Mage's quarters, as a member of the Psijic Order has shown up at the College and wishes to speak with them. After the Dragonborn has a private conversation with Quaranir, Ancano confronts him, but Quaranir feigns ignorance to his demand for answers and soon departs.
Mirabelle has explained that members of the Synod recently visited the College, mentioning the Staff of Magnus. The Dragonborn is asked to head towards Mzulft, as the Synod were last known to be heading there. After arriving, the Dragonborn discovers that Ancano has barricaded himself in the Hall of the Elements with the Eye, using its power for the benefit of the Thalmor and Aldmeri Dominion. When Savos, Mirabelle, and the Dragonborn enter to confront him, he uses the Eye to unleash a powerful blast that wounds Mirabelle and stuns the Dragonborn.
The Dragonborn needs to retrieve the Staff of Magnus from within Labyrinthian and return with it to the College of Winterhold. Mirabelle remains behind with the other mages to try and hold off Ancano, but when the Dragonborn returns, they learn that Mirabelle is dead, having sacrificed herself to hold off Ancano long enough for everyone else to escape. Tolfdir volunteers to join the Dragonborn with entering the College and dealing with Ancano once and for all.
With Tolfdir aiding them, the Dragonborn breaches the magical barrier Ancano has surrounded the College with and enters the Hall of the Elements to confront Ancano, who mocks their efforts to try and stop him when he believes himself to be invincible now thanks to the Eye. When Tolfdir tries to hit him with a Fireball spell, Ancano retaliates with a Mass Paralysis spell, incapacitating Tolfdir so he can face the Dragonborn alone, and opening the Eye to render himself invulnerable to damage until the Dragonborn can close it with the Staff of Magnus. After the fight, Ancano falls to the Dragonborn and is slain, and the Eye is taken by the Psijic Order to ensure its power does not fall into the wrong hands ever again.",Ancano,Ancano,MaleUniqueAncano,High Elf,Male,,124888,124887

Anders and Nystrom posed as priests of Nocturnal to obtain the Sepulcher's treasure, which, according to Nystrom's notes of Lythelus' riddles, was found inside Pilgrim's Path. Anders subsequently murdered Nystrom and left his body inside the first room of the Twilight Sepulcher so that he would not have to share the treasure.
As part of the last riddle, Anders jumped down into a pit, but found himself trapped at the bottom and eventually starved to death.

On the 19th of Second Seed in 4E 201, Andurs invited Runil, an Altmer priest of Arkay in Falkreath, for a visit. They shared some words for nine days until Runil finally left Whiterun on the 28th of Second Seed.[1]
He asks the Dragonborn to recover his amulet so he can rebuke the corpses that have risen in the Catacombs. Once completed, he gives the Dragonborn 15 . Even after the Dragonborn has given Andurs his amulet, the dead will continue to rise in the crypts.
To obtain the maximum reward for this quest, retrieve the amulet, return it to him and then kill him. Since he is alone, it is quite easy to do with no consequences.
He is also involved in a quest in which the Dragonborn is required to deliver a dagger to Andurs from the grave tender Alessandra, who can be found in Riften located at The Hall of the Dead. 
Andurs also has an unused line of dialogue that was supposed to be initiated if the Dragonborn found and returned to Andurs his amulet before being given the quest. However, this line never plays in-game because his amulet does not actually appear unless the quest has been started.[2]",Andurs,Male Sly Cynical,MaleSlyCynical,Nord,Male,,108173,80808

When training with her, she will talk about her family, with each stage reveals more about her and how her family trained her to use a bow.
Her mother was the one that trained her with the bow, as her father was frequently absent. Her mother taught her that the secret was speed and composure. She also taught her that keeping calm, even in the midst of chaos, will allow arrows to always find their target.
When she was younger, her older brother would take her out hunting. At the time, food was hard to come by, making it difficult to put food on the table, let alone sell at the market. Whenever the two of them came across multiple deer in a single area, it was important to kill as many as possible. This helped her not only become accurate but quick.

Anoriath is one of the victims of the Dark Brotherhood contracts. If he dies, his coffin can be found in the Whiterun Hall of the Dead. If the Dragonborn kills him or his brother, the surviving brother may send hired thugs to avenge the killing.
According to his brother when asked how they came up with the name ""The Drunken Huntsman,"" he says that one night he and his brother became intoxicated by drinking a large amount of mead. When they went on a hunting trip, they got lost and were separated. Anoriath saw his brother and mistook him as a deer and accidentally shot him with a bow. After the adventure, they decided to have it as the name of their shop. If asked, Anoriath says he hunts most of the meat himself.
Anoriath is generally friendly when interacted with and seems to be a keen huntsman, as suggested when he tells the Dragonborn that he hunted all of the game he sells at his stall himself, and that it is 'fresh from the wilds', even though it is rare to see him or his brother outside of Whiterun.
Nazir gives the Dragonborn a contract to kill Anoriath in Whiterun. It is easiest to assassinate him when he is at his shop. During the quest he will say ""Well now, you are a strange one.

As a follower, she typically wields magic and prefers her own robes over items placed in her inventory. Aranea can also be inducted into the Blades.
She descends from the Dunmer cult that worshiped Azura sometime before the eruption of Red Mountain. When the Dragonborn visits the Shrine, she sends them to search for the stolen Azura's Star. If the Dragonborn cleanses the artifact upon their return by entering it and killing the souls within, Aranea afterward offers to become a follower.

Clearing the bounty and re-approaching her fixes this, as well as simply waiting three days or cast a calming spell or ability on her.

It is unclear what these methods were or how they were offensive, however, given his current status, it seems possible he used underhanded, duplicitous techniques that would have offended the Companions' sense of honor. He joined The Circle and became a werewolf prior to his expulsion.
He initially disapproves of the Dragonborn, showing a rude attitude, but after several successful assassinations, he begins to respect and even envy the Dragonborn.
If the Dragonborn is also a werewolf, however, he will immediately know and react a bit more amiably. Regardless of whether they are a werewolf or not, Arnbjorn will use little nicknames such as ""lambshank,"" ""beef roast,"" ""tidbit,"" or ""hamhock."" He says not to take offense from the nicknames.

He and his fellow Greybeards live at High Hrothgar. He can be found meditating in one of the wings of High Hrothgar, sleeping in the bedroom at the western end of High Hrothgar, or in the High Hrothgar Courtyard behind the building.
He is one of the only two Greybeards that will talk with the Dragonborn or any other inhabitant of Tamriel, the other being Paarthurnax.
After the Dragonborn retrieves the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, he can be asked where to find a Word of Power by asking ""Have you located any Words of Power?"" Then there are two possible replies: ""We heard a whisper of a Word. Give me your map, and I will show you where its echo can be found"" - with that, a location will be added to the map and a miscellaneous objective will be added to the Journal. If he has no locations to show you, Arngeir will say: ""There is only silence right now. Perhaps later we will hear one of the lost Words.""
If the Dragonborn speaks to him about the Blades wanting Paarthurnax killed, he will respond by calling them bloodthirsty barbarians and will mention his warning to the Dragonborn about the Blades when the Dragonborn asked about the Dragonrend shout. If asked about what the Blades said about Paarthurnax, he will reveal that what they say is true, but will explain that all dragons served Alduin and that, had it not been for Paarthurnax, the rebellion against Alduin would have failed.
If the Dragonborn says they will not kill Paarthurnax, he will respond saying that Kynareth bestowed the gift of wisdom on the Dragonborn and urges them to continue on their path. If this is done before Season Unending, when Delphine says that the Blades deserve to be there because they sent the Dragonborn down that path, he will counter saying they (The Greybeards) know what path the Blades put the Dragonborn on, but they have chosen a different path. He will then say that Paarthurnax is safe from the Blades' malice, to which Delphine says ""for now"" and that the Blades' memory is long. Should the Dragonborn say that they are still unsure of what to do, Arngeir will highlight the need to think the decision through carefully, but will still praise the decision by saying, ""Doing nothing can be the wisest choice, although strangely often the most difficult.""
If the Dragonborn chooses to kill Paarthurnax, Arngeir will reprimand them for doing so. He will say, ""This is how you repay our trust?! Paarthurnax's trust?! His noble spirit... the wisdom of ages... his deep understanding of our existence... all gone and for what? A mindless vendetta urged on by a cabal of Akaviri barbarians!

/wiki/Arniel_Gane,"Arniel Gane is a Breton mage and senior member of the College of Winterhold and a researcher of peculiar magics. He wears Adept Robes of Alteration.
He leads an excavation at the tomb of Saarthal and will hope to experiment with Kagrenac's tools, the latter of which he is highly secretive of. Arniel is located in the first room on the right on the second floor of the Hall of Attainment.
After the Dragonborn's first lessons as a new student of the college, Tolfdir and the other apprentices venture to Saarthal to assist Arniel with his excavation. Upon arriving, the Dragonborn is tasked with collecting three Enchanted Rings and an amulet. Performing the errand ends with the Dragonborn being imprisoned behind iron bars. Upon being freed, Tolfdir and the Dragonborn investigate a hidden tunnel in the tomb, eventually coming in contact with a member of the Psijic Order. After discovering the Eye of Magnus in the rooms below the tomb, the Dragonborn returns to inform Savos Aren. Any time after this event, the Dragonborn can give the Enchanted Rings to Arniel, but it is not required.
Arniel helps the Dragonborn and Faralda defend Winterhold against Magic Anomalies in Containment. During the battle, he will not personally use magic to attack, instead relying entirely upon unarmed combat. However, he will reanimate characters who die during the battle as zombies for further assistance.
As part of a secret experiment, Arniel tasks the Dragonborn with retrieving ten Dwemer Cogs. After finding the artifacts, the Dragonborn must then contact Enthir about a Warped Soul Gem Arniel wanted from him. Enthir was reluctant to provide the item to Arniel, but relents if the Dragonborn retrieves a staff Enthir accidentally sold to a necromancer. Enthir surrenders the gem after the staff is returned to him. This eventually allows the Dragonborn to use the Warped Soul Gem in a Dwemer Convector three times, along with Arniel's Convection.
Arniel disappears as a consequence of his research with the Warped Soul Gem. However, the Dragonborn gains the ability to summon his shade in battle. Arniel Gane's shade can be seen wandering the area around the College of Winterhold after his quest line has been completed. Besides simply not being around, Arniel's disappearance has little, if any, effect on the rest of the mages at the College.
Is there any College business I can assist with? ""You mean the official sort of business? Hmm, well... no. No, not really. But... I can't help but notice that you're doing quite well for yourself, rising through the ranks and all. It may not be ""official"", but there is a, uhh, project I've been working on. I wonder if perhaps you could assist with it.""
I've got the cogs you asked for. ""Ah, that's excellent news. This will be most helpful in furthering my research. I'm afraid I can't offer you much right now, but please take this. And perhaps, if this is all successful... Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's too early to be getting excited. Still, this is most encouraging. Thank you again. If I require anything else, I shall be sure and let you know.""
How is your project coming along? ""Terrible, just terrible. I vastly underestimated the heat transfer necessary, and have destroyed my only working model. I'm at a loss.""

Enthir really doesn't have whatever it is you asked him for. ""What? I... I don't understand. Where is it?""

/wiki/Arniel%27s_Shade,"Arniel's Shade is a ghost of the College of Winterhold mage Arniel Gane, who was destroyed or possibly transported to another plane at the conclusion of the quest ""Arniel's Endeavor."" The Dragonborn will witness this unexpected occurrence, when given the spell to summon the apparition, which is called Summon Arniel's Shade.
The spirit appears just as Gane himself did the last time the Dragonborn saw him in person, except that the robes he's wearing include a hood. He is summoned by a two-handed Conjuration spell that requires no Magicka, and he remains with the Dragonborn as an ally for sixty seconds. The ghost will engage any nearby enemies (including dragons), and he moves aggressively around the combat area attacking with a continuous lightning stream that appears to be a stronger version of the Sparks spell: it may be true that this is the only method of attack he makes use of.
Arniel's Shade, from the time he is summoned to the time he vanishes, certainly appears to be beyond injury of any kind, and elsewhere this has been attributed to his ghostly nature. It's possible that he has never been observed on his hands and knees in a nearly incapacitated state, as has been the case with numerous other followers over time; furthermore, it is also possible that he has never been dispatched by an opponent before the spell's sixty seconds of time has expired. However, when not in combat and following the Dragonborn Arniel's Shade can be heard gasping or perhaps retching from time to time, as if in pain or suffering.
The Dragonborn, if close enough, is given the prompt to talk to the spirit when not in combat, but he does not respond to this and no dialogue options are available. Consequently, just like a summoned Atronach but unlike a genuine follower, Arniel's Shade can't really be interacted with, insofar as he cannot be asked to wait someplace, or carry some of the Dragonborn's extra weapons or gear.
However, while the Dragonborn can't interact with the ghost, the ghost does attempt to interact with the Dragonborn. If his sixty seconds of time are nearly gone and he is not in combat, he will periodically speak to the Dragonborn when nearby: sometimes it's nothing more than the general question, ""Yes?"" At other times the ghost seems to actually recognize the Dragonborn personally, and, depending on the circumstances, will say something specific, ""What can I do for you, Arch-Mage?""

His known relatives are Unmid, his brother; Nura, his mother; and Vulwulf, his father.

/wiki/Astrid_(Skyrim),"Astrid is the leader of the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim and wife of another Dark Brotherhood member, Arnbjorn. She resides in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, near Falkreath, and holds the responsibility of finding new recruits in the Night Mother's absence.
When asked about herself after the Dragonborn joins the Dark Brotherhood, Astrid says that she had an uncle who made ""unwanted advances"" towards her, so she killed him. It ""felt good, really good,"" so she killed another, unspecified person, and it ""felt even better."" At some point, she joined the Dark Brotherhood and later married another Brotherhood member, Arnbjorn.
Astrid decrees her authoritarian leadership to be ""stronger"" than The Five Tenets. She tires of the laws and restrictions that limit the Brotherhood, deciding that a sort of family-like unity benefits the members of the Brotherhood better than rigid structure. Upon the arrival of the Night Mother and the discovery that the Dragonborn is the new Listener, Astrid, with her leadership threatened, sold out the Dragonborn to the Penitus Oculatus.
However, Commander Maro betrayed Astrid, ordering an attack on the Falkreath Sanctuary which resulted in the deaths of most of the assassins, out of personal revenge for their part in the death of his son. Astrid realizes her mistake in thinking she was the sole authority of the Brotherhood by going against the Five Tenets, as ""they have guided the Brotherhood for centuries. I was a fool to oppose them,"" and as well for leading to the deaths of most of the Brotherhood. Before her death, she pleads forgiveness for her transgressions against the Night Mother and the Dragonborn.
Successfully killing Grelod the Kind for Aventus Aretino causes Astrid to kidnap the Dragonborn once the Mysterious Note is received. She brings them to an abandoned shack in the Hjaalmarch swampland and asks them to kill one of three hostages. Regardless of whom the Dragonborn kills, Astrid gives them directions to the Sanctuary, the password to get past The Black Door guarding the Sanctuary, and invites them to join her ""family.""
Should the Dragonborn choose to kill Astrid instead during this encounter, Commander Maro learns of the deed and tasks the Dragonborn with eradicating the remaining members of the Dark Brotherhood.
Once the Dragonborn has arrived at the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary just outside of Falkreath, and used the password to get past The Black Door, Astrid directs them to speak to Nazir for side contracts the Dark Brotherhood has received until she has an important one for him.
Once the Dragonborn returns from completing one of Nazir's initial contracts, Astrid tells them to head to Markarth to speak to Muiri about a big job she has requested of the Dark Brotherhood. Once the Dragonborn returns from completing the job, Astrid asks them how it went before assigning them their next quest.
Astrid asks the Dragonborn to spy on Cicero, as she suspects that he is plotting with another member of the sanctuary to destroy the Brotherhood. The Dragonborn obeys, hearing the Night Mother speak and becoming her Listener. Threatened by the Night Mother's choice, Astrid reclaims her authority by sending the Dragonborn on off-handed contracts until she investigates the contract the Night Mother told the Listener.
After the Dragonborn returns from completing another of Nazir's contracts, Astrid decides that since the Night Mother has spoken and revealed a contact for a contract in Amaund Motierre at the Nordic Tombs of Volunruud, she sends the Dragonborn to check it out. Once there, Amaund gives the Dragonborn two items to deliver to Astrid. Once they are delivered, Astrid directs the Dragonborn to speak to Delvin Mallory of the Thieves Guild in The Ragged Flagon in Riften for more info. Once the Dragonborn returns with a Letter of Credit from Delvin for Astrid, she prepares to carry out Amaund's request: The murder of Titus Mede II, Emperor of the Mede Dynasty, with the first target being his cousin, currently living in Solitude, Vittoria Vici.
In a bid to carry out Amaund's hit on the Emperor of the Mede Dynasty, Astrid plans to assassinate the Emperor's cousin, Vittoria Vici, during her wedding to Asgeir Snow-Shod in Solitude, which was part of an intended plan to try and broker peace between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks and create a ceasefire in the Skyrim Civil War, and assigns the Dragonborn to carry out the hit on Vittoria. After Vittoria is successfully murdered, if the Dragonborn's cover was blown, Astrid will dispatch Veezara to aid the Dragonborn in escaping the angry crowd of wedding guests, hold guards, and Penitus Oculatus agents and retreat back to the Sanctuary.
With Vittoria dead, and word of the Emperor on his way to Skyrim to oversee the Skyrim Civil War personally now public knowledge, the next step to assassinating the Emperor was to convince his elite guard, the Penitus Oculatus, that there was no threat to the Emperor's life at the moment, causing them to let their guard down. To do that, the plan was to murder Commander Maro's son, Gaius Maro, and plant an Incriminating Letter on him to make it look like an attempt on the Emperor's life by the Stormcloaks had already been foiled, and Gaius was a traitor, providing Ulfric and his men all the details for the hit in secret. This would distract Maro and thus reduce the chances of being caught performing the hit on the Emperor later.
Since the return of the Night Mother, Astrid has become more uneasy in her trust of Cicero, feeling like his return of the Night Mother's body to the Dark Brotherhood is threatening her leadership. She dispatches the Dragonborn to deal with Cicero, but in the end, the Dragonborn can either kill or spare Cicero upon confronting him in the Dawnstar Sanctuary, and either lie or tell the truth of his death to Astrid to put her at ease.
With Cicero dealt with and Maro distracted with his belief that his son was a Stormcloak spy, Astrid now assigns the Dragonborn to locate and kill Balagog gro-Nolob, also known as ""The Gourmet,"" a well-known and famous Orc chef, using his fame as a disguise to get into Castle Dour to assassinate the Emperor during his visit by poisoning his meal, but also make certain to hide The Gourmet's body so that no one will suspect that the Dragonborn is impersonating him.
With everything set to carry out the assassination of Emperor Titus Mede II when he is in Skyrim and staying at Castle Dour in Solitude, Astrid sends the Dragonborn to carry out the murder, disguised as the Gourmet. However, it turns out that Astrid, fearing that her leadership of the Dark Brotherhood was threatened by the Dragonborn being the new Listener for the Night Mother, betrays them and reports the assassination attempt to the Penitus Oculatus and Maro himself, in return for amnesty and protection of the Dark Brotherhood. As a result, the Dragonborn only succeeds with killing a decoy Emperor. Maro, however, reveals he had no intention of upholding his end of the agreement with Astrid and sends his men to attack the sanctuary after they killed his son to ensure that Astrid and the Dark Brotherhood would not threaten the Emperor any further.
Upon the attack on the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, many of the assassins of the Dark Brotherhood fell, including Astrid. When she is found, her body is charred and burned beyond recognition. She begs the Dragonborn to kill her by performing The Black Sacrament, dubbing the Dragonborn her replacement as leader of the Brotherhood and admitting she was wrong for defying the Night Mother and the Dark Brotherhood's Five Tenets. She also explains that she negotiated with the head of the Penitus Oculatus, Commander Maro, into revealing the identity of the Dragonborn in exchange for political immunity. Maro went back on his word, attacking the sanctuary in revenge for his son. She asks to be killed with her Blade of Woe, but she can be killed with any weapon. After Astrid's death, the Dragonborn and the remaining assassins, including Nazir and Babette, move to the Dawnstar Sanctuary, where Cicero fled and can still be found if he was spared.
Should the Dragonborn choose to kill Astrid instead of one of the hostages, her death will need to be reported to a guard as soon as possible. Learning of Astrid's death, the Dragonborn will be directed to report to Commander Maro at the Penitus Oculatus outpost in Dragon Bridge to notify him of Astrid's death. Learning of her death, Maro assigns the Dragonborn to head for their sanctuary in Falkreath to wipe the rest of the group out. Once done, Maro commends the Dragonborn for getting rid of the Dark Brotherhood and will report their success directly to Emperor Titus Mede II, thanking them for saving the Emperor from any threat the Dark Brotherhood may have posed to him.
When does the wedding start? ""Soon. I'm not exactly sure when. But not to worry - the ceremony itself is being followed up by a public banquet that will last for several days. Both Vittoria and her husband will be there for the duration, and everyone in Solitude is invited to attend. You'll have plenty of opportunity.""
Give me the details. ""With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, the Imperial Legion will need to begin its preparations immediately. Security is being handled by a man named Voltus Agallon. His job is to travel throughout Skyrim, and ensure each city is prepared for Mede's visit. You must find and kill Voltus Agallon. Doing so will disrupt security sufficiently that we will be able to, eventually, get to to the Emperor.""

/wiki/Augur_of_Dunlain,"Augur of Dunlain is a divination artifact in Skyrim, found within the Midden Dark level of The Midden below the College of Winterhold.
The man who would become the Augur of Dunlain was once a gifted Breton student of the college. Though he was undoubtedly brilliant, he was over-zealous in his pursuit of his discipline of magic. Through unknown means, his soul became fused with the energies around the college, resulting in his current state. Since then, the Augur has been known for its wisdom, but the people of the College do not like to talk about it. The only one willing to discuss it is Tolfdir.[1]
The Dragonborn confides in the device, at the request of Quaranir, to receive aid with locating the Staff of Magnus.

According to his brother, Aval is ashamed of his siblings for working for Nords. However, he has a good attitude towards the tolerant Brunwulf Free-Winter and will offer him a discount on his merchandise.
Aval hints at dealing in stolen goods, warning the Dragonborn that, if they're the type to worry about where something came from, they may want to move on, in addition to claiming he is resourceful as he is discreet. Torsten Cruel-Sea and Tova Shatter-Shield may approach him regarding acquiring new farm equipment and picking up Friga's belongings.

/wiki/Aventus_Aretino,"Aventus Aretino is a Nord child in Windhelm found in the home of his deceased parents. When found, he is performing the Black Sacrament in hopes of contacting the Dark Brotherhood. Desiring the death of Grelod the Kind for mistreating the children at Honorhall Orphanage, he asks the Dragonborn to fulfill the contract. If successful, he gives them the Aretino Family Heirloom.
Aventus lost his mother, Naalia, when he was roughly ten years old; the fate of his father is unknown. Because he had no one else to care for him, Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak sent him to Riften to live at the Honorhall Orphanage. At the orphanage, he developed a strong hatred for the headmistress Grelod the Kind, who, despite her name, was extremely cruel to him and the other children. Aventus escaped from the orphanage and returned to the now-deserted house in the middle of Windhelm, where he had lived with his mother when she was alive. When the Dragonborn encounters him, he is attempting to contact the Dark Brotherhood by performing the Black Sacrament.
Grimvar: ""Then it's true, what everyone is saying? That Aventus Aretino is doing the Black Sacrament? Trying to summon the Dark Brotherhood?""Idesa: ""Oh, Grimvar... always with the nonsense. No, no, of course not. Those are just tales...""Grimvar: ""Fine. Then I'll invite him out to play. He lives right there. I'm going to knock on his door...""Idesa: ""No, child! Wait!

But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin. Now, enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.""
Upon entering the house, Aretino chants the prayer to the Night Mother repeatedly while stabbing an effigy made up of human parts as he pleads for the Night Mother's help. No matter what is said, Aventus is sure that the Dragonborn has come to fulfill the contract if he is spoken to, and the quest ""Innocence Lost"" begins.

He ended up staying for a few decades, becoming an uncle of sorts. During this time, he taught Avrusa Sarethi how to grow Nirnroot and she has been doing it ever since. Avrusa explains that in order to grow nirnroots, the juice of the Jazbay Grapes is needed for its acidity; bringing 20 of them to her will reward the Dragonborn with 5 random potions.

He will be in the Gray-Mane clan house, hiding in one of the bedrooms. Upon opening the bedroom door, Avulstein will begin to speak, explaining that he is paranoid about meeting the same fate as his brother who is missing. He is certain that the Battle-Borns are behind the disappearance of his brother and wants proof stolen from their house.
The Dragonborn can help to find out the fate of his brother and rescue him from Northwatch Keep. Should the Dragonborn agree to join Avulstein with rescuing Thorald, Avulstein will round up two of his allies that have life debts with the Gray-Manes, Geirlund and Vidrald, and join the Dragonborn to assault Northwatch Keep and save Thorald. After rescuing him, Thorald decides it is not safe for him or Avulstein to return to Whiterun with the Thalmor hunting them and decides that the two will head to Windhelm to join the Stormcloak rebellion.
I'm not sure I want to get involved in this. ""Please, I'm desperate. This is my brother's life! I won't let them take it away! I beg of you, look for proof of Thorald's capture. The Battle-Borns have it, I just know it.""

At the age of ten, Babette was bitten by a vampire, becoming one herself. She has lived over three hundred years as one, and boasts about how her innocent appearance makes killing easier. Due to her age, it can be inferred that she was alive during the Oblivion Crisis of 3E 433.
In the Falkreath Sanctuary, she sells potions and alchemy items. Babette has more gold than the typical alchemist. She is always available for Alchemy training. Money Babette receives as a skill trainer is added to her available funds to buy things as a merchant. Babette cannot be pickpocketed or harmed in any way because she has the body of a child.
She, along with the Dragonborn, Nazir, and Cicero (if he was not killed in the earlier quest ""The Cure for Madness"") are the only members of the Dark Brotherhood to survive the Penitus Oculatus attack on the Sanctuary. As such, she moves to the Dawnstar Sanctuary and continues selling potions.

If asked if she is hunting she may remark that, while Nazir cooks at the Sanctuary, she has ""more refined tastes.""

/wiki/Balgruuf_the_Greater,"Balgruuf the Greater
Balgruuf the Greater is the Nord Jarl of Whiterun Hold, residing in his great hall, Dragonsreach. He is a major character in the main quest of Skyrim.
Jarl Balgruuf wears noble clothes, fur-lined boots, and a gold and ruby circlet for a crown. The Jarl's weapon is a unique war axe (which can only be acquired through Pickpocket) that carries his name—Balgruuf's War Axe. If the Dragonborn fights Balgruuf in ""Battle for Whiterun,"" he will equip Steel Plate Armor, minus the helmet.
He has a brother named Hrongar, and three children, Frothar, Dagny, and Nelkir. No one ever mentions the Jarl's spouse. Nelkir mentions how he does not have the same mother as Dagny and Frothar during the quest ""The Whispering Door.""
While eventually becoming loyal to the Empire, he puts Whiterun's interests first, many times denying the Imperial Legion permission to garrison soldiers in his city so as not to portray martial law―if he is asked what side he is on in the war, he will say that he is ""on the side of Whiterun,"" showing a great sense of loyalty towards Whiterun. In his neutral stance, he remarks that he may well be obligated to support one or both sides; the Empire as a province, the Stormcloaks out of loyalty to Skyrim. Indeed, he will only express open hatred of the Stormcloak Rebellion after the Dragonborn chooses a side in the Civil War, slandering them if they seize Whiterun with the Stormcloak army under Ulfric and his second-in-command Galmar Stone-Fist; according to Gerdur, Balgruuf and Ulfric had been at odds for years and fears Balgruuf will side with the Empire out of spite.[1] Balgruuf's distaste for the Stormcloaks may stem from the fact that he had refused to declare allegiance for either side, but Ulfric attacked Whiterun anyway by deeming anyone who did not support him as an enemy, as it was said by Ulfric during the Markarth Incident, ""You are either with us, or against Skyrim."" He is generally more interested in dragons than the Civil War in which he is involved. Since Whiterun's provisions were terribly diminished during the Skyrim Civil War and Ulfric's uprising had doubled the costs of goods, Balgruuf ultimately sided with the Empire in order to preserve the more lucrative trade agreements with the Empire.
According to his son Nelkir, he still worships Talos and hates the Thalmor as much as Ulfric and the other Nords do, if not more. If encountered at the party at the Thalmor Embassy, he will make this view very clear and will also be more than happy to disrupt the proceedings on behalf of the Dragonborn.
Balgruuf has strong bonds with his friend and Housecarl, Irileth, whom he fought alongside with during his time in the Legion. As such, she rarely lets him out of her sight and berates him for a lack of concern for his personal safety.
According to the Official Game Guide, Balgruuf is viewed by many as the embodiment of a true Nord and his allegiance with the Empire as having actually convinced many would-be Stormcloaks that the Empire may actually be the answer to Skyrim's problems.
After the Dragonborn appears before the Jarl to tell him of the dragon attack on Helgen, the Dragonborn learns that another dragon, Mirmulnir, is attacking the Western Watchtower. Together with Irileth and several Whiterun Guards, the Dragonborn defeats the dragon and returns to the Jarl. Jarl Balgruuf then dubs the Dragonborn Thane of Whiterun, therefore the Dragonborn receives Lydia as their Housecarl. Balgruuf then advises that they visit the Greybeards at High Hrothgar for instruction on how to learn the Thu'um.
The Dragonborn needs to trap a dragon in Dragonsreach with the Jarl's help.
Balgruuf is present during the peace negotiations between the Imperials and the Stormcloaks, but only if he is still in control of Whiterun depending on if the Battle for Whiterun from allying with the Stormcloaks is completed beforehand or not. If completed first, Vignar Gray-Mane will be in attendance in his stead representing Whiterun while on Ulfric and Galmar's side of the table. If Balgruuf is still Jarl, he will be with Elisif, General Tullius, and Legate Rikke on their side, with or without being joined by Elenwen.
Deliver Ulfric's axe to Jarl Balgruuf or deliver Balgruuf's axe to Ulfric. (depends on whether the Dragonborn sides with the Imperials or Stormcloaks)
At first, Balgruuf will remain neutral in the Civil War. But once the Dragonborn chooses a side, Balgruuf will eventually decide to help the Imperial Legion, regardless of which side the Dragonborn chose. If the Dragonborn sided with the Legion, Balgruuf will give a speech at the end of the battle once the Stormcloaks are driven off. Alternatively, siding with the Stormcloaks means the Dragonborn must fight Balgruuf, Irileth, and several of the Whiterun Guards during the assault. If Vignar Gray-Mane becomes Jarl of Whiterun, Balgruuf, along with Irileth and Proventus, travel to the Blue Palace in Solitude, seeking refuge with Imperial sympathizer Elisif the Fair.
Once the Dragonborn is recognized as a Thane of Whiterun, they are given a housecarl named Lydia, who can serve as their follower. Additionally, he grants the Dragonborn permission to purchase Breezehome, a house in Whiterun, for 5000 . He also presents the leveled Axe of Whiterun to the Dragonborn, a status symbol of the Thanes of Whiterun. A sword, rather than an axe, may be received.
Balgruuf is having problems with his son Nelkir, whose personality seems to have turned dark.
Are you ready to spring the trap on the dragon? ""My men will be ready when you are, Dragonborn. You have a truce to arrange first, eh?""
I have an important message from General Tullius. ""No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times must I deny him? Well? Out with it.""
Ulfric means war. ""You've returned with my axe. I knew that would be his response. As soon as you left I sent word to General Tullius, who's been kind enough to lend us some of his troops and Legate Cipius here. Let Ulfric try to make it past our combined forces. I'll turn you back over to your Legion. Legate Cipius will have use for you. Gods be with us all.""
Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak asked me to deliver this axe to you. ""Did he now? Ha. The man is persistent, I'll give him that. I suppose it's time I give him an answer...""

General Tullius said you'd get me outfitted. ""Yep. I have just one question for you. Light, medium, or heavy?""

Upon meeting him, he will speak of the current trading situation in the Whiterun region. Because of the dragon attacks in Helgen, there is a lack of products around the city, which impacts the prices, as less supply than demand equals higher prices.

As a Nord, he is very proud of his heritage, and will express amazement when in Nordic Tombs, and will even go as far as suggesting to the player that a few treasures should be left behind, as a sign of respect. However, he also nervously states that he doesn't want to end up as a ""shambling corpse"" when he dies. He also has some knowledge of the Dwemer, though he considers the Nords more hardy, as they ""outlasted"" the Dwarves, despite their ""advanced"" culture. He also is nervous around Dwemer ruins, stating that they make him ""uneasy."" He has a tendency to comment on most locations, mainly their architecture or significance.
After hiring him for the standard 500  fee, and if the Dragonborn has the Amulet of Mara on their person, Belrand becomes a marriage option. Belrand is also able to be recruited into the Blades.
Belrand is a spellsword that fights well with magic users and archers. He is well known for his stalwart resilience against death, for he has both healing spells and quick health regeneration. He cannot be killed by other creatures but can be killed by the player, albeit only when he is in the knocked out state.
Belrand can be married if the Dragonborn has the Amulet of Mara equipped and has him as a follower. If married, like all spouses, he opens a business that makes a daily profit of 100 . He will hold onto the gold as it increases until asked for it. He will buy or sell items, and, if asked, he will become a follower once more.
As a spellsword, Belrand has high skills in Destruction magic, one-handed weapons, and light armor, but can also use two-handed weapons and bows (albeit at lower effectiveness). At the initiation of combat (and despite having low Alteration and Conjuration skills), he often summons a familiar and casts Oakflesh or Stoneflesh on himself.

Benor can be found hanging around outside of the Guardhouse, inside its cellar, or the bridge during the day and inside the Moorside Inn at night.
When encountered by the Dragonborn, Benor will want to demonstrate his fighting abilities, as he claims to be the best brawler in Morthal. If he is beaten in a brawl, he will give the Dragonborn 100  and become available as a free follower.
Benor is one of the ""strong citizens"" sent by the Jarl to accompany the player character to Movarth's Lair to clear it out, but will leave with the others rather than assist unless he is a follower to the Dragonborn.
Benor can be married if the Dragonborn has the Amulet of Mara. Marrying Benor gives the miscellaneous quest to Visit Your Spouse's House, for which the Dragonborn will have to break into the guardhouse, since that is where Benor sleeps. It is a novice lock, but the guards will levy a fine of 15  for the break-in if the Dragonborn is detected. The lock eventually resets.
If Benor moves with the Dragonborn to a different house, he will still own a shop, and the daily share will continue to accumulate and be available for collection.
As a follower, Benor works best if equipped with heavy armor and any Two-Handed weapon. He is proficient in archery too. His stamina is relatively small, so giving him a weapon with absorb stamina is ideal. Having good block skills, he can absorb great amounts of damage if equipped with decent armor, and absorb health can help him endure more damage.",Benor,Male Brute,MaleBrute,Nord,Male,,109157,79336

Borgakh is first encountered either using the training dummy in front of Larak's Longhouse or being inside the house itself. If engaged in conversation, she expresses her envy towards the Dragonborn, who, unlike her, can travel wherever and whenever they wish.
She explains that she will soon be of age and, by tradition, will be married to one of the Orc chiefs from another stronghold. To that end, she trains so that she may offer her strength to the other tribe while her own people will receive good trade in return, thus benefiting both tribes. Asking for Borgakh's opinion on the matter will have her confess that she actually feels caged. She admits that, while she once looked forward to meeting new people and seeing new places when being of age, she no longer feels the same way about it. Furthermore, she elaborates on that it is the chieftain who actually chooses which chief she will have to marry, and that she still has no idea who that will be.
When requesting Borgakh to become a follower, she will at first decline, stating that, despite her feelings, she will follow the traditions of her people, and that she does not want to shame her ancestors. However, after further persuasion (or through paying off her dowry), she will choose to follow the Dragonborn after all, quoting that Malacath also teaches the Orcs to follow their own fate.
When Borgakh becomes a follower, she will confess her feelings for the Dragonborn when the latter is wearing an Amulet of Mara, calling them strong and clever while declaring marriage feels right this time. After the wedding ceremony is over she will remark that Nord weddings are vastly different from Orc weddings, observing that Nord weddings involve less blood and violence.

/wiki/Braig,"Braig is a Breton Reachman who is imprisoned in Cidhna Mine and a member of the Forsworn rebellion.
Braig was imprisoned in Cidhna Mine because he was caught speaking with Madanach. He says that his daughter, Aethra, begged Jarl Hrolfdir to take her instead. The Jarl's men beheaded Aethra in front of Braig, then sent him to the mine anyway. He reveals that his daughter would be 23 years old now.
During the course of the quest ""No One Escapes Cidhna Mine,"" Madanach will tell the Dragonborn to speak to Braig and learn his story, as he will with the other imprisoned Forsworn. Talking to him during this will reveal Braig's past and why he was arrested, as well as why he affiliates himself with Madanach because of his daughter.

/wiki/Braith,"Braith is a Redguard child living in the Wind District of the city of Whiterun.
Braith is the energetic and belligerent daughter of Amren and Saffir.
Braith's mother, Saffir, wants her daughter to start reading more and stop getting into fights with just about everyone she runs into, but Braith will either ignore her mother or frown at her when she overhears this. She has a secret crush on Lars Battle-Born, which appears to be the reason why she is bullying him. If the Dragonborn convinces Braith to stop harassing Lars, she will suddenly blurt out that she would not have to bully him in the first place if he would just kiss her.
Lars Battle-Born will request that the Dragonborn convince Braith to stop bullying him. After being confronted with her behavior, Braith will then grudgingly agree to give Lars a break. She will also bluntly state that ""If he'd only kiss [her], [she] wouldn't have to beat him up all the time!""
The Dragonborn can play ""hide-and-seek"" or ""tag"" with Braith, Mila Valentia and Lars Battle-Born.
If one wishes to adopt Braith through less noble means, one easy way is to enter Amren's house during the day (the house is usually unlocked while his wife is home), then hide on the left side of the bed, between the bed and the wall. From here, it is rather easy to kill Saffir with a stealthy arrow shot—even if Amren is home. While Amren is seated in the chair by the front door, he is also an easy target.
As long as Braith does not witness the Dragonborn firing either arrow, she will not become hostile, though she may panic or flee, and say, ""You're mean. I hate you, I hate you forever and ever and ever."" Even if she is hostile, using the spell Calm will keep her at bay until she calms down and starts saying things like, ""What...what am I gonna do?""
At which point she (and all other children in Skyrim who are orphaned through similar circumstances) can be adopted, whether directly or by waiting for her to go to Honorhall.",Braith,Female Child,FemaleChild,Redguard,Female,,108139,80809
/wiki/Brand-Shei,"Brand-Shei, born Brandyl,[1] is a Dunmer shopkeeper residing in Riften, where he sells miscellaneous goods from his stall during waking hours.
Orphaned as a child and raised by Argonians from a very early age, Brand-Shei believes he originally came from the House Telvanni in Morrowind. He traced his ancestry back to a maid of the House, who escaped during an Argonian invasion. His mother died sometime thereafter, but his father remained to write a journal about the event. At the time, Brand-Shei had not been named by his parents, as his father, Lymdrenn Telvanni, did not feel right about doing so without his wife's consent.
Sometime before his death, he named his son Brandyl. The journal was kept by the boy's nurse, Hidrya Olen, who hoped to one day give him the news of his parents. She died in the attempt. The journal confirmed that he was the last known surviving member of House Telvanni, along with Brelyna Maryon, who is a descendent of them. He was proven wrong about the house being destroyed, however, since House Telvanni still has an influence on Solstheim and Morrowind; as the Telvanni Wizard Neloth states that the House still has their holdings.
Brand-Shei plays a role in the Thieves Guild questline, where the Dragonborn must frame him for stealing Madesi's ring in the quest A Chance Arrangement. Brand-Shei is temporarily jailed confirmation needed after this if the Dragonborn is successful.
The Dragonborn is instructed to place a stolen ring in his pocket, resulting in his arrest. The quest is given by Brynjolf, a member of the Thieves Guild, and is the first step to becoming a member of the guild.
Brand-Shei's cell in the Riften Jail can be unlocked by either lockpicking or using the Riften Jail Key from the guards. If his cell is unlocked, he will not leave the jail, he will just stand there. When spoken to, he stammers about his innocence. If his quest to find more of his past is started but unfinished and the stolen goods are planted on him, the dialogue option to finish the quest will not be initially offered if he is talked to in prison. After several days, though, it will be offered, even while he is still in prison.
It is possible to avoid him being sent to jail by failing the objective. The quest will go on and it is still possible to join the Thieves Guild regardless.
The Dragonborn may accept to search for clues to Brand-Shei's past. Directed to search the Wreck of The Pride of Tel Vos, southeast of Winterhold, a journal detailing Brand-Shei's past can be found in a water-logged chest on the lower deck of the wrecked ship. He rewards the Dragonborn with a key to his strongbox. It is also possible to find the journal without having spoken to Brand-Shei. Under this circumstance, the Dragonborn receives the reward from him immediately upon their first interaction.
If armor or weapons are dropped near Brand-Shei, he often argues about the items, claiming that they belong to him now, which can possibly lead to a fight.
Brand-Shei is a general goods merchant. As with many other merchants in Riften, his stall operates between the hours of 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM. He sells various ingots, soul gems, jewelry, potions, weapons, and armor. All of his wares are leveled.",Brand-Shei,Male Dunmer,MaleDarkElf,Dark Elf,Male,,105948,78671

/wiki/Brelas,"Brelas is a Bosmer pawnbroker and servant working at the Thalmor Embassy. She serves Colovian Brandy to Elenwen's party guests. Brelas expresses a strong dislike for Erikur, a Thane of Solitude.
A goblet of Colovian Brandy can be received from Brelas, which is used to bribe Razelan to make a scene in front of the other party guests. Doing so allows the Dragonborn to sneak into the backrooms with Malborn and retrieve their gear, in order to fully scout the Embassy in search of information on the Dragon Crisis.
Alternatively, the Dragonborn can tell Brelas they will convince Erikur to stop his advances on her. When talking to Erikur, if he is told that Brelas wishes to meet him in his chambers after the party or that she does not want his company, he confronts her directly, causing a distraction sufficient enough for Malborn and the Dragonborn to escape the party.
Either way, she will be condemned to the interrogation room, where she can be freed later.
If she becomes imprisoned and later successfully rescued, she can be found with Malborn in the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm after escaping the Thalmor Embassy, if she and Malborn survive making it there. She will stay there until Malborn's quest is complete, where she will then follow him to the Skyrim-Morrowind border east-southeast of Windhelm.

/wiki/Brelyna_Maryon,"Brelyna Maryon is a Dunmer mystic in Skyrim who is an apprentice at the College of Winterhold, in Winterhold. She is involved in two of the first quests for the college. Brelyna becomes a candidate for marriage and a possible follower after the Dragonborn assists her with an experiment. She resides in the Hall of Attainment, where she has her quarters.
Brelyna is a somewhat introverted yet diligent student of the mage arts. Though not as skilled as J'zargo, she is more than capable and is touted as having natural talent, even though she is a bit clumsy with her spells. Having come from a place where expectations were very high for her as a descendant of a line of powerful Telvanni mages, Brelyna enjoys the lack of expectations or peer pressure and gladly focuses on studying at the College at a pace that she is comfortable with.
When first spoken to, Brelyna may come across as brusque and unsociable due to her disdain with constant questioning, assuming that the Dragonborn will do the same. She will however quickly apologize and politely introduce herself when they prove otherwise. Afterward, she is often polite when spoken to, if a bit shy.
Brelyna is not fond of talking about herself, particularly her race, but if inquired about the Dunmer's history to Winterhold she will explain that many elves visited the College over the years.
She also seems to have an innate fondness for reading books, and can often be found doing so wherever she may be.
Brelyna participates in the Dragonborn's Ward lessons at the college. Along with J'zargo and Onmund, she underestimates the necessity of practicing caution when casting spells. Depending on the Dragonborn's reply to Tolfdir when asked, either her, Onmund, or J'zargo will respond accordingly.
After the Dragonborn's first lessons at the college, Brelyna accompanies the group to Saarthal, where Arniel Gane conducts research regarding several relics found there. Tolfdir assigns her with the task of detecting magical wards.
Brelyna requires assistance with practicing a new spell. The Dragonborn can agree to be the target of her spell. When cast, the first spell turns their vision green. Brelyna then comments that they look ""a little green."" Wait for five hours, sleep, or finish other quests until the effect wears off, then return to Brelyna. Attempts with the second spell turn the Dragonborn into several animals. Once Brelyna manages to restore her subject's usual form, she will speak to the player and the quest will complete, unlocking her ability as a follower.
After the Dragonborn completes the quest Brelyna's Practice, Brelyna becomes a marriage prospect and will offer that option during a conversation if the Dragonborn is wearing the Amulet of Mara.
If the Dragonborn helps Brelyna experiment with her spells, she agrees to become a follower. She can be inducted into the Blades after arriving at Sky Haven Temple with Delphine and Esbern.
Brelyna is able to deal a significant amount of damage with spells. Brelyna opens every fight with Oakflesh and uses Flames and Firebolt offensively. She also often summons Flame and Frost Atronachs to aid her in battles. Due to her low health pool, she cannot endure many attacks. Unable to be killed by opponents, she can be killed by the Dragonborn.
As with most followers, when sneaking she waits for a cue to engage in combat, even refusing to attack an enemy that has engaged her specifically until the Dragonborn breaks stealth.
As with all mages, her pathing can sometimes cause her to attack targets which have not been revealed yet. Also, her spells make noise when cast, rendering sneaking somewhat difficult with her along. This can be offset by giving her sneaking-enchanted gear and by choosing battles carefully. She can be instructed to wait if a delicate situation arises.
Although she equips any weapons or armor given to her, she seldom uses them above spells.
Brelyna disapproves of theft and becomes hostile toward the Dragonborn for doing so. She may also send hired thugs to punish the Dragonborn if they steal from her.",Brelyna Maryon,Female Young Eager,FemaleYoungEager,Dark Elf,Female,,115108,115094

/wiki/Brina_Merilis,"Brina Merilis is a retired Nord Legionnaire in Skyrim who resides in Dawnstar. She will become Jarl of the Pale if the Legion occupies Dawnstar.
Brina is a stern woman who tolerates no foolishness from those under her command, a trait she shares with fellow Nord Legate Rikke. She does have a warm side that sometimes shows, but this is rarely seen due to the Civil War.[1] When it comes to the recent return of the dragons, Brina is able to see how serious the problem is, unlike Skald, who simply believes that the dragons will vanish once the Empire is driven out.[2] If Brina becomes Jarl, she proves to be a more respected ruler than Skald,[3][4] understanding Dawnstar's vulnerabilities to dragon attacks and making preparations to alleviate the issues. Likewise Brina is flexible and open minded, acknowledging the flaws of the empire which she supports[5] as well as convincing Madena to aid the town with her healing abilities as a mage.[6]
Brina did not come from Skyrim originally, but from Cyrodiil. She came to Skyrim with the Legion. Once she joined the legion, she was renowned throughout the Legion for her leadership and her tactical ability. She met her man-at-arms and friend, Horik Halfhand.
After she retired from the legion she ended up in Dawnstar with Horik. The Jarl, Skald the Elder, does not trust her because of her past and accuses her of espionage in favor of the Empire. However, most of the citizens of Dawnstar would rather go to her to get guidance than the Jarl and so she is one of the most prominent people in Dawnstar.
Brina is a possible target needed to be intimidated by initiating a brawl.
If the Dragonborn joins the side of the Empire in the Civil War, and takes Fort Dunstad in their favor, Skald the Elder will be exiled from the Pale and as a natural choice Brina will take his place.
If she becomes the Jarl during ""Season Unending,"" and the Dragonborn later retakes the Pale for the Stormcloaks, she and Horik will be exiled to The Winking Skeever in Solitude.
Brina ""Divines sakes, Skald, who do you think we're threatening with our old war wounds? We're not soldiers anymore."" Skald ""Your man Horik is wearing his Legion armor. What am I to make of that?"" Brina ""He's proud of his service, Skald. The Legion taught us loyalty, and we're loyal to Dawnstar."" Skald ""This isn't over. I catch you sending one letter to General Tullius, I'll have you both executed.""
Brina ""I'm fine, Horik. I just... are you worried about this war?"" Horik ""No. If we must fight, we will, and you will lead us to victory. As you always have."" Brina ""With you by my side, is that right, Horik?"" Brina ""So much for old soldiers settling down to a life of luxury, eh?""
Brina ""You never talk about yourself much, do you, Horik? I swear, these past 30 years you've been at my side and I think I barely know you."" Horik ""What's to say? I was born on a farm, joined the Legion when I came of age, and I've served you ever since."" Brina ""What about your family? There must have been someone waiting for you back at the farm. Wondering if you were ever coming home?"" Horik ""No. Can't say that there was. My parents died when I was young. You and the Legion have been my only family since."" Brina ""I see.

Brother Verulus asks the Dragonborn to investigate the mausoleum where corpses have been found with evidence of being eaten. Inside you will find Eola, who will either attack you or give you the Daedric quest ""The Taste of Death,"" depending on your dialogue choices. If you agree to join the cannabalism cult, you will be given the task to bring Verulus to Reachcliff Cave. After you bring him there, Eola will appear to somehow hypnotize Verulus into sleeping on the altar, and she will give you the task to kill Verulus and feast on his corpse. After doing so, Namira will present you with the Ring of Namira.
Alternatively, you still have the option to save Verulus at the last minute and kill Eola, which will fail the quest. Verulus will suddenly stand up from the altar and aid you in the ensuing fight with the cultists, and after everything settles down, he will give you a leveled amount of gold as a reward for saving him.
Siding with the Stormcloaks in the Civil War causes Thongvor to become Jarl of Markarth. Because of this, the two will not be seen arguing in Understone Keep. Instead, Brother Verulus is found near the entrance to the Hall of the Dead.
Brother Verulus is one of the quest characters that can be given equipment and exploited to follow the Dragonborn throughout Skyrim along with a follower of their choice. If he is never brought back to the altar, then he will remain as a constant follower. He cannot be used to carry anything, but he will fight in any situation. Just like Enmon, he can be commanded to do tasks and be told to also wear a full set of Daedric armor. He is invincible (until he arrives at Reachcliff Cave) and does not require enchantments unless it is at one's sole discretion.",Brother Verulus,Male Young Eager,MaleYoungEager,Imperial,Male,,113551,78732

He is known for standing up for the Dunmer and Argonians in the city and thus openly goes against the opinions of some of his fellow Nords, although he is also in a relationship with Elda Early-Dawn, who is openly bigoted towards non-Nords. Susanna the Wicked also shares his compassion for outsiders, unlike Rolff Stone-Fist and Angrenor Once-Honored. Interestingly, if the Dragonborn is a Khajiit or an Argonian, he will use the terms ""cat"" and ""lizard.""
Brunwulf is made Jarl of Windhelm if Ulfric Stormcloak is killed by the Imperial Legion. He claims he is taking steps to make the Nords accept the Argonians in Windhelm, although it may take time as most Nords shared Ulfric's vision. Because of this, Brunwulf keeps the Argonians segregated from the city until those Nords accept them. He also says he plans with the Dunmer to renovate the Gray Quarter to improve their lives in Windhelm, although he admits he has no current plans to do so as Windhelm is low on resources.

/wiki/Brynjolf_(Skyrim),"Brynjolf is a Nord thief and a member of the Thieves Guild in Riften. Brynjolf is currently the second-in-command at the Thieves Guild, below only Mercer Frey, the current Guildmaster.
Brynjolf is first encountered upon entering the Riften Marketplace for the first time, or if it is after dark, in The Bee and Barb. He approaches the Dragonborn and offers to let them in on a job on which he is working. If they accept, this starts the quest.
He says that he will create a diversion in the market. While everyone is distracted, the Dragonborn must break into the stall belonging to the Argonian jeweler Madesi, steal his ring, and place it into the Dunmer merchant Brand-Shei's pocket without getting caught. The ring is under the stall inside a locked strongbox, not in the display case.
If the Dragonborn is successful, after Brand-Shei is arrested, Brynjolf will happily say that he found the right person for the job. He then directs the Dragonborn to the Ratway, an underground tunnel system underneath Riften, explaining that there is a tavern there called The Ragged Flagon, and if they can get to it, they can join his organization. If the Dragonborn fails to plant the ring, they will still be asked to go to the Ragged Flagon and join the Guild.
Upon reaching The Ragged Flagon, Brynjolf will be impressed. After then asking the Dragonborn to collect some debts owed to him from several of the shopkeepers or business managers in Riften, namely Keerava, Haelga, and Bersi Honey-Hand, he will then introduce the Dragonborn to Mercer Frey, the Guildmaster, and induct the Dragonborn into the Thieves Guild.
Brynjolf helps the Dragonborn by providing information and advice for future jobs.
During the main line of quests for the Thieves Guild, Brynjolf and the Dragonborn become Nightingales, like guildmaster-turned-traitor Mercer Frey, to assist Karliah with seeking revenge on him for his various crimes against the Thieves Guild and their patron Daedra in Nocturnal.
After the Thieves Guild main questline, Brynjolf can be found wandering around the cistern and the flagon. Due to a bug, when spoken to, he will say that he has important things to do and will talk sometime later, rather than speaking his scripted post-quest dialogue.

/wiki/Calcelmo,"Calcelmo is an elderly Altmer Conjurer who can be found in Understone Keep where his nephew, Aicantar, helps him in the laboratory. He has a great interest in the Dwemer and is the author of many scholarly works about them.
Calcelmo owns the Dwemer Museum and has been excavating Nchuand-Zel. As a scholar of Dwemer history and culture, he has written several books about them, including Dwarves, v1, Dwarves, v2, and Dwarves, v3. He also is an expert on the Falmer, having deciphered most of their language.
After the Dragonborn buys the first piece of the Dwarven armor set, or the first Dwarven weapon, including Dwarven Bolts and arrows, a courier shows up with a letter from Calcelmo, in which he asks for one to be brought to him. Finding, stealing, looting, or crafting an item that Calcelmo would normally be interested in does not trigger the courier.
When the item is taken to Calcelmo in Understone Keep, it can be sold to him through dialogue. Calcelmo may be persuaded to pay more. However, if the dialogue option, ""Not good enough. I'll hold onto this. You'll need to find another one,"" is chosen, that particular deal will be cancelled and can never be re-initiated.
During the Dark Brotherhood questline, the Dragonborn will be taken to the Abandoned Shack, where one of the prisoners in the shack may be killed. An execution hood can be taken from the corpse. If the hood is sold to a vendor then purchased back, the Dragonborn will receive a note from a courier saying that Calcelmo would like to buy the hood, similarly to Dwarven weapons or armor.
When talking to Kerah, she will ask the Dragonborn to deliver a ring to Calcelmo. Afterwards, the ring may be bought from him.
In order to gain access to the Dwemer Museum, the Dragonborn must have Calcelmo's permission either through Speech, by having helped Calcelmo with a previous quest, or by pickpocketing the key from him. Alternately, the lock on the door can be picked.
Calcelmo will give the keys to both the museum and the dig site if the Dragonborn defeats Nimhe. Nimhe is a large Frostbite Spider that is inhibiting the progress of the excavation of Nchuand-Zel.
The Dragonborn is sent to help Calcelmo confess his love for Faleen, the Housecarl in Understone Keep.
Calcelmo grants access to Nchuand-Zel after the Dragonborn kills Nimhe.

/wiki/Calixto_Corrium,"Calixto Corrium is an Imperial shopkeeper in Windhelm. As the owner of Calixto's House of Curiosities, he offers tours of the items he and his sister collected during their travels in Tamriel. 
During his adult life, Calixto and his sister, Lucilla, were bequeathed a large fortune.[1] Traveling Tamriel, they collected several rare items, such as The Book of Fate, The Dancer's Flute, and Ysgramor's Soup Spoon. Unfortunately, his sister died during this time, and so after settling in Windhelm, he opened a curiosity shop in her name to display their collection.[1]
Secretly, the grief of losing his sister was too much for him to bear, and Calixto began to lead a life of necromancy in hopes of resurrecting Lucilla, which involved the murder of several young women in Windhelm.[2] The basis for this ritual appears to be of Aldmer origin, and was then interpreted by the Ayleids and first transcribed by the Altmer.[3] To help this, he authored a journal in three parts, which describe the exact elements needed for the magic to work,[3] and for this purpose, he acquired the Necromancer's Amulet[4][5] and Nordic embalming tools to use on the victims.[6]
In addition to an unknown first murder, his second victim in the necromantic ritual was Friga Shatter-Shield, the twin sister of Nilsine;[7] doing so gave him access to Hjerim, which he took up residence for the ritual.[4] He then planned to kill Susanna the Wicked, believing her tendons to be of exquisite quality, and apparently came close to doing so before being thwarted by the appearance of guards.[8] The ritual is almost complete as the Dragonborn arrives in Windhelm.[2][3] His actions have earned him the name ""the Butcher,""[7][9][10] to which Viola Giordano has placed letters all throughout the city in order to warn the people of Windhelm about him; however, Calixto has taken most of these down so they do not hinder his efforts.[4][7][10]
Calixto is a relatively jovial man, happily proclaiming for all to visit the House of Curiosities for their enjoyment. He appears to enjoy displaying his collection, saying that he believes his sister would be proud to bring smiles to visitors.[1] That being said, after Wuunferth reveals the true nature of the Strange Amulet, he claims that Calixto and his books are ""often confused"" on such matters, although Wuunferth does say that it happens to ""the best of us,"" suggesting that the mage holds some respect for Calixto.[5] Guards also seem to respect him to a degree, saying he ""has a good eye"" for strange trinkets.[7] Jorleif believes Calixto to bit a bit ""odd,"" although he stops short of suspecting anything dubious about the imperial.[11]
Calixto secretly criticizes the mages at the College of Winterhold for dabbling in magic with which they are already familiar, glamorizing the possible innovations of necromancy.[8] He also appears to have little respect for Windhelm, calling the guards ""idiots""[8] and describing portions of the city and its populace as ""rugged bits.""[2] He is completely devoted to the necromantic ritual, to the point of showing little to no remorse for murdering women besides a passing comment at Susanna's murder scene;[1] however, this could be but an act. His devotion appears to come from his relationship with his sister, whom he loves dearly, and describes as someone who loved the world so much while he did not.[2] On top of everything, though, he appears to hold a sense of righteousness to what he is doing, believing that the women he has murdered ""would surely thank me for the great gift I give them.""[2]
Calixto Corrium appears at the scene of Susanna the Wicked's murder. When questioned by the Dragonborn, he says he saw the culprit run off, but can give little else. He, along with Silda the Unseen and Helgird, are released as suspects after their questioning. After learning that the killer used Nordic embalming tools from Helgird, the Dragonborn later discovers a Strange Amulet at Hjerim, and are directed towards Calixto for further investigation into it. Calixto claims the amulet to be a ceremonial Wheelstone, and that it belongs to Wuunferth the Unliving, the court mage. After lying that Wuunferth dabbled in necromancy before serving the Jarl, Calixto requests to buy the amulet for 500 . The Dragonborn can accept this or refuse, although refusing will make the Necromancer's Amulet unobtainable. 
Based on this information, the Dragonborn will accuse Wuunferth of the crime. If they choose to speak to Jorleif, he will shortly arrest the court mage, and the case will close. Windhelm will appear safe again for a few days. Unfortunately, the Dragonborn will find a new female body outside of Candlehearth Hall, where guards will be in disbelief since the killer had been caught; Calixto will be at the scene again, although he will have nothing special to say. The Dragonborn goes to the imprisoned Wuunferth, who will make it clear that the true murderer eluded capture. He will then assist the Dragonborn in catching the Butcher. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can speak to Wuunferth directly in the Palace of the Kings, who will prove his innocence by telling that he was investigating the murders himself. In this case, Calixto will not claim a fourth victim. Regardless of the path chosen earlier, Wuunferth predicts where and when the next murder will occur and, suspecting the killer will strike again that same night, he sends the Dragonborn to the Stone Quarter. 
Calixto as he murders Arivanya in the Stone Quarter.
Arriving in the market, the Dragonborn will find Calixto standing to the side; unlike everyone else in the market, he will keep to himself. After a moment, his next victim—Nilsine Shatter-Shield, Jora, Hermir Strong-Heart, Idesa Sadri, or Arivanya—will suddenly scream as Calixto approaches. The guards do not react to the murder, and so it is up to the Dragonborn to save the victim. If not stopped in the marketplace in time, Calixto will kill his target and then run to Hjerim, where he will be hostile to the Dragonborn upon entering. Calixto is shortly killed and the murderous streak is brought to an end.
While in the House of Curiosities, Calixto offers tours of the trinkets he and his sister collected for 2 ; paying this will begin the tour of his collection. Of The Book of Fate, he will claim that it displays the destiny of those who read it, although it appears blank to the Dragonborn. He will then direct the Dragonborn to Ysgramor's soup spoon, where he will remark that it is indeed a fork, but that this did not stop Ysgramor from using it. He will next inform them of The Dancer's Flute; he tells that it has destroyed empires and won wars, claiming that it will force those around to dance uncontrollably, although he will stop short of activating it.

Two men in Riverwood vie for Camilla's attention—Faendal and Sven. The Dragonborn can play a part in which of the men she chooses by getting involved in the quest ""A Lovely Letter."" If she marries the Dragonborn, both men continue to express interest in her. Faendal will still visit Camilla, even if she is living with the Dragonborn in another city. (see notes below)
When the Dragonborn first enters the Riverwood Trader, they will see Camilla arguing with Lucan about the theft of the golden claw. When offering to retrieve the claw, Camilla will ask Lucan if she could accompany the Dragonborn to Bleak Falls Barrow, which he denies, but he says she can accompany the Dragonborn to the edge of the town. The Dragonborn need not wait for Camilla, but if they do she will give him directions, and then return to the Riverwood Trader. When the claw is recovered, she expresses her gratitude toward the Dragonborn.
To begin this quest, speak to either Faendal or Sven. Both men will claim Camilla is already theirs, but will give the Dragonborn a fake letter for Camilla that supposedly comes from the other's rival. The Dragonborn may then choose to help either of the two men win Camilla's affections by lying to her or by telling her the truth about the false letter.
After recovering the golden claw from Bleak Falls Barrow for Lucan, Camilla will become a candidate for marriage. Upon marriage, she opens a shop where items can be purchased and sold. From the shop's profits, she gives her spouse 100  daily. If uncollected, the profits accumulate. She can continue to live at the Riverwood Trader, and the Dragonborn can move in with her there, or she can be asked to move into another home.
After completing ""The Golden Claw,"" the Dragonborn can steal back the golden claw. Camilla may hire thugs to teach the Dragonborn a lesson if they are caught. This may occur even if she has been killed or married. Killing Lucan may either make her send hired thugs, or send the Dragonborn a letter saying Lucan will not be missed.

He ordered Garnag, a fellow Brotherhood assassin, to murder Rasha, a member of the Black Hand who had falsely claimed to be the next Listener. Eventually, through the months after the last Listener's death, the remaining Brotherhood members left the Sanctuary to look for contracts or food and never returned, leaving Cicero trapped alone in the Cheydinal Sanctuary. Eventually, he grew more and more insane from obsessing over his last kill, isolation, and due to trying to talk to the Night Mother and become her Listener. Eight years later, he wrote letters to Astrid in Skyrim to appeal for sanctuary, fleeing from Cheydinhal to Skyrim with the Night Mother's coffin.
Widely regarded as bothersome, obnoxious, strange, and insane, Cicero sports flamboyant attire and often speaks with a high-pitched voice. Cicero speaks to both himself and the Night Mother's remains often, and as such, he is considered psychotic. As Keeper of the Night Mother, Cicero takes his vocation very seriously, willing to wound or even kill anyone who questions or ignores the Night Mother's authority, although he was not always like this; as evident from his first two journals, before becoming Keeper, Cicero was quite sane, comparatively speaking. His final contract involved killing a jester, and slowly, while most of his fellow assassins were being killed in Cyrodiil, Cicero descended into madness, obsessing over the jester, and adopting aspects of the jester's persona.
While traveling north of Whiterun, the Dragonborn may encounter a peculiar man in a jester's outfit with a broken-down cart. It turns out his name is Cicero and he will beseech them to aid him, stating he needs repairs for his wagon wheel to move his mother's (The Night Mother's) corpse to a new burial site.
Cicero arrives at the Sanctuary with the Night Mother's remains.
Cicero is suspected of treason against the Dark Brotherhood when he continuously locks himself in a room with the Night Mother. He can be heard mumbling, but no one can hear what he is saying. Suspecting that Cicero and another member of the brotherhood are conspiring to betray the other members, Astrid sends the Dragonborn to investigate. The Dragonborn hides in the Night Mother's coffin, eavesdropping on Cicero and his conspirator. While hiding, the Dragonborn learns that Cicero is, in fact, speaking to the Night Mother's remains, although she does not speak back; his private sessions with her were his attempts to verify himself as being the Listener, the one person who can hear the Night Mother speak. Shortly after this discovery, the Dragonborn hears the Night Mother's voice, becoming the Listener. Exiting the coffin, Cicero at first suspects the Dragonborn of defiling the Night Mother's remains, but soon realizes that she has selected the Dragonborn as the Listener. Bitter that he was not made Listener, yet still excited to hear the news, he congratulates the Dragonborn.
Astrid barges into the room, accusing Cicero of conspiring against the Brotherhood. Cicero explains that the Dragonborn is the new Listener; however, despite this Astrid gets ready to attack him. Violence is averted when the Dragonborn explains that the Night Mother spoke to them. Astrid sends the Dragonborn on several contracts, until she can sort out the mess.
After killing Gaius Maro on his inspection route, the Dragonborn returns to the Falkreath Sanctuary, finding Veezara wounded, Arnbjorn missing, and Astrid quite disgruntled. In a fit of defiance, Cicero attacked Astrid for challenging the Night Mother's authority, but was intercepted by Veezara. Surviving the skirmish, Cicero fled to the Dawnstar Sanctuary, Arnbjorn following close behind. Arriving at the sanctuary, the Dragonborn finds Arnbjorn bleeding heavily and searches the sanctuary for Cicero. Battling through several spectral assassins, the Dragonborn finds Cicero, wounded and babbling. The Dragonborn has the option to kill Cicero, but if they decide not to, Cicero remains at the Dawnstar Sanctuary, even after the Penitus Oculatus destroys the Falkreath Sanctuary.
If the Dragonborn chose to spare his life, Cicero is found upon exiting the Dawnstar Sanctuary after ""Hail Sithis!,"" where he becomes a possible follower. Cicero is flagged as essential before ""The Cure for Madness."" and after the quest, if he is spared.
While following the Dragonborn, he makes several off-beat jokes and humorous observations about the current location or quest. While not following the Dragonborn, he lurks around the sanctuary near the Night Mother's sarcophagus, talking to himself and tending her.
Cicero is a unique follower in the fact that he will often, for no reason, start to dance if he is a follower. This can happen at any time, anywhere, regardless of what outfit Cicero is wearing.
Cicero is also unique in that he is the only named follower, other than Serana, who cannot be recruited into the Blades. The only other followers who cannot join the Blades are the Dark Brotherhood initiates.
His default outfit has no defense, and as such he will wear any armor given to him.
It is still possible to get Cicero's clothes after sparing him. Although it is not possible to take his clothing while he has it equipped, even with the Perfect Touch perk, by telling him to follow and then giving him any armor. He equips it, making it possible to pickpocket his clothing if he is relieved as a follower, but in this case the inventory tells that the chance to pickpocket the hat, the shoes, and the clothes is 0%. Having him follow the Dragonborn once more allows for their armor to be retrieved. This can be used to get multiple sets of Cicero's clothes since each time armor is removed from him, his original clothes return.
A copy of Cicero's default equipment, called the Jester's Outfit, lies on a table in the Dawnstar Sanctuary, meaning it is not necessary to kill, pickpocket, or use console commands to obtain his outfit. However, the enchantments on this equipment are weaker and its value is less.",Cicero,Cicero,MaleUniqueCicero,Imperial,Male,,638128,638127

Upon witnessing the Dragonborn casting a spell, he will approach and ask if the Dragonborn could turn him invisible. As there are no spells that confer invisibility on anyone but the caster, it is impossible, but the Dragonborn may trick him into believing he has been turned invisible. Doing so, however, has no apparent effect.
The Dragonborn can play tag with Clinton, however, he will be the only target since he is the only child living in Dragon Bridge.

/wiki/Commander_Maro,"Commander Maro is an Imperial and the leader of the Emperor's special security force, the Penitus Oculatus. He serves as the main antagonist of the Dark Brotherhood questline. 
He is in charge of protecting the Emperor during his visit to Skyrim. He is the father of Gaius Maro. He is also in charge of dealing with any matter of politics such as the Civil War.
If the Dragonborn chooses to destroy the Dark Brotherhood, Commander Maro provides them with the pass phrase for the Falkreath Sanctuary. Alternatively, siding with the Dark Brotherhood allows the Dragonborn to assassinate Maro for an added bonus, during the assassination of the Emperor.
After the death of the Emperor's cousin, Vittoria Vici, Emperor Titus Mede II's visit to Skyrim becomes almost apparent. As the Emperor's visit approaches, Maro assigns his son, Gaius Maro, to verify the security of the major Holds. However, Gaius meets his demise at the hands of the Listener.
At the beginning of the quest, Maro can be found outside of Castle Dour awaiting the false Gourmet.
Later, Commander Maro intercepts the Listener after he or she successfully assassinates a decoy of the Emperor, after the Listener is betrayed by Astrid. Maro promised to spare Astrid and the Brotherhood if she gave up the Listener, but consumed by hatred for the Brotherhood for killing his son, Maro goes back on his word, ordering his Penitus Oculatus agents to kill the Listener and leading the Penitus Oculatus to destroy the Falkreath Sanctuary, seeking to kill everyone in the Dark Brotherhood. The Listener escapes the wrath of Maro's agents and returns to the Sanctuary to find it in flames, kicking off the mission Death Incarnate.
The Dragonborn can choose to kill Commander Maro, although his death is optional. If the Dragonborn chooses to spare him, if he spots the Dragonborn when they are near him he will say, ""You again!"" If they interact with him, he will exclaim in utter disbelief at their survival and immediately attack them to finish the job.

/wiki/Constance_Michel,"Constance Michel is an Imperial who works at Honorhall Orphanage, in Riften, with Grelod the Kind. She wears a belted tunic and boots.
In stark contrast to Grelod, who is cruel and uncaring, Constance is a kind person. The children say that she is ""nice"" to them, and they want her to be in charge; Aventus Aretino specifically requests that Constance be spared, showing how beloved she is. Even though she is appalled at her treatment of the children, Constance defends Grelod, saying that she was old and knows no other life. Constance is the only person in the orphanage to express any sorrow at Grelod's demise.
If the Dragonborn travels to Honorhall Orphanage in Riften (possibly at the behest of Aventus Aretino), Grelod will be seen berating and threatening the children. It is not possible to talk to Grelod, but Constance can be asked if Grelod is always that cruel to the children. Constance will admit that she is, and then try to usher the Dragonborn out, explaining that the children are not up for adoption, and it is cruel to get their hopes up.
If Grelod is killed, Constance enters a state of panic, but does not defend Grelod or alert the Riften Guard. She sometimes may not panic, but will instead casually walk out of the orphanage, yelling at the Dragonborn to get out, even when spoken to outside. With Grelod gone, Constance takes over as orphanage headmistress, and conditions improve greatly for the children there, although she continues Grelod's policy of not allowing the children to be adopted.
With the Hearthfire DLC installed, Grelod will still not allow the children to be adopted, but Constance will be delighted to do so. Shortly after Grelod has been killed, a courier will deliver a notice and announce that the orphanage is under new management, and that the ""new lady in charge of the orphanage"" has instructed him to hand out the notices to everyone he encounters. The letter urges the Dragonborn to consider adoption, either from the orphanage or elsewhere.
If an offer is made to adopt a child from Honorhall, she will be delighted, but will ask questions, such as if they have a house with a child's bedroom and the prospective new parent's occupation. If a suitable home exists, she says to go and speak to the child they wish to adopt, and promises to get them safely to their new home. Her reaction to the Dragonborn's occupation varies depending on the answer.
Whether she saw the murder of Grelod or not, Constance will remain in a state of panic from Grelod's death until ""Innocence Lost"" is completed by talking to Aventus Aretino. However, she will not acknowledge the Dragonborn as the murderer once this questline is completed. If Hearthfire is not yet installed, she will simply state that the children are not up for adoption (since no adoption system is in place) and ask the Dragonborn to leave. If Hearthfire is installed and one asks to adopt a child, Constance will not mention Grelod's murder, even if she saw it happen.
While Grelod is alive, the flyer will not be delivered, and it will not be possible to adopt children from Honorhall. If the Dragonborn asks about doing so, Constance will explain that Grelod is the headmistress, and she is not allowing any adoptions. It will still be possible to adopt orphaned children from other places, as long as the Dragonborn has a house with a child's bedroom.
If the Dragonborn adopts two kids who are not from the orphanage before Grelod's death, and then kills her under the mission requirements, the notice will never be received.

A courier will bring a letter to the Dragonborn for the first time after they use a dragon shout in virtually any location. This activates a radiant quest, in which the Dragonborn learns the locations of new Word Walls throughout Skyrim.
Letters revealing the locations of Word Walls can be stolen from the couriers. This can sometimes result in the courier sending Hired Thugs after the Dragonborn.
In The Elder Scrolls V: Hearthfire, couriers are one way of activating the process of buying a plot of land to build a homestead on, as they will bring a letter from one of the three Holds.
Couriers can bring letters when the Dragonborn acquires certain enchanted weapons or types of weapons or armor from vendors or from smithing/enchanting them. These quests usually ask the Dragonborn to deliver said weapon to a rich researcher who offers suitable reward for bringing them the item. A good example is the Letter from Calcemo.
Couriers will deliver the Letter of Inheritance when someone close to the Dragonborn dies. Often, these letters are accompanied by various sums of .
Couriers can be found in inns across Skyrim. They do not deliver anything to the Dragonborn, but can be pickpocketed for a radiant Courier's Letter. Sometimes a courier may enter an inn or tavern but, if followed inside, will not be there.
Couriers may be found in the wild, either being a Stormcloak or Imperial courier. They run to an area and respond generically when talked to. They can also try to get the Dragonborn to join whatever faction they are affiliated with. If the courier wanders into an area controlled by the opposite faction, they will be attacked and killed. Despite being named Courier, these characters do not carry any messages, except during certain civil war quests.

Deeja is shown to be very antisocial, and attempts to converse with her prior to ""Lights Out!"" will result in her telling the player to back off, and later she will threaten you to stop trying to talk to her. 
After the Dragonborn has put out the fire in the Solitude Lighthouse, Deeja can be found inside the Wreck of the Icerunner.

To the right of his bedding is a chest with a bear trap in front of it, and on the other side is a Dibella Statue.
Stealing the items around the camp is a good source of income, as it will respawn occasionally, especially after Deekus has been killed.

/wiki/Delphine_(Skyrim),"Delphine is a Breton who lives in Riverwood with Orgnar. Together, they run the Sleeping Giant Inn. Her main role is to help discover the mystery behind the dragons and their re-emergence. However, she is secretly one of the last surviving members of the Blades and will become the order's acting Grandmaster once the main questline is advanced far enough.
Before talking with her during the main quest, Delphine has little social interaction beyond that of a regular innkeeper, as well as expressing suspicion of the Dragonborn through dialogue.
According to her Thalmor Dossier, Delphine is in her mid 50's and a high-priority target for the Thalmor. During The Great War, she evaded attempts at her life several times, ultimately escaping the Thalmor and being stationed in Cyrodiil. She returned to Skyrim, remaining alert to the surveillance of the Thalmor.[1]
After the Dragonborn retrieves the Dragonstone and returns to Dragonsreach with the Dragonstone for Farengar, the Court-Wizard will be discussing the ancient Nords with Delphine and how they defeated the dragons. There she will be wearing her leather armor with a Thieves Guild Hood. If the Dragonborn tries to speak to Delphine, she will just tell them to ""mind their own business.""
Delphine is the acting Grandmaster of the Blades faction, one of the last remaining members operating in Skyrim. While searching for the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller for Arngeir, the Dragonborn finds a Mysterious Note in its place at Ustengrav, saying to go to the Sleeping Giant in Riverwood and rent the attic room. At the inn, Delphine approaches and relinquishes the Horn, demanding to speak in private. She reveals then that she is a member of the Blades, seeking the next Dragonborn.
To provide sufficient proof of being truly Dragonborn, she asks for help in slaying a dragon at Kynesgrove. There, they find Alduin, the same dragon that attacked Helgen, resurrecting Sahloknir, another dragon. Completing this, she believes that the Thalmor may be involved with the re-emergence of dragons in Skyrim.
Suspecting the Thalmor are behind the return of the dragons, Delphine sends the Dragonborn to the Thalmor Embassy, in hopes of finding some sort of explanation of the dragons' return. However the only thing found out was that the Thalmor were looking for Esbern, the only other remaining member of the Blades. From what they learned from torturing a member of the Thieves Guild, Etienne Rarnis, was that Esbern was somewhere in The Ratway sewers beneath Riften.
After finding Esbern, Delphine learns of the location of a hidden sanctuary known as Sky Haven Temple. The Dragonborn, Esbern, and Delphine set out to find this sanctuary and claim it.
After returning from the Thalmor Embassy, with knowledge of Esbern's location, Delphine sends the Dragonborn to Riften's sewers to look for Esbern.
After gaining entrance to Sky Haven Temple, the Dragonborn can ask Delphine why there are only two Blades members. She then re-explains that the Thalmor hunted them down during the Great War. From there the Dragonborn can bring up to three followers to Sky Haven Temple, to recruit them into the Blades. After that, Esbern will send the four out to slay dragons.
Upon reaching High Hrothgar for the peace treaty, Delphine and Esbern will arrive and begin arguing with Arngeir. Eventually, he agrees to let them participate in the meeting.
Delphine reveals that she is aware of Paarthurnax's existence and demands his death as part of the quest. Unless the dragon is slain, the Blades will no longer assist the Dragonborn, and items at Sky Haven Temple will be considered stolen.
What should we do? ""We need to find the burial mound. Let's ask in the inn."" ""That was well done. Come on. I've been wanting a closer look at one of these buggers.""
""My oath binds me, Dragonborn. Until Paarthurnax is dead, you aren't welcome here."" (If in Sky Haven Temple)

/wiki/Delvin_Mallory_(Skyrim),"Delvin Mallory is a Breton thief in Skyrim. He is a high-ranking member of the Thieves Guild in Riften.
Delvin Mallory wrote the book Shadowmarks, which helps members of the guild recognize both valuable targets and places that should be avoided when doing jobs to avoid getting in trouble with the Hold Guards and potential jail time or bounties on their heads.
Delvin is the brother of Glover Mallory and unknowingly the uncle of Sapphire. He also has a younger sister, according to the Bonemold Formula.
Delvin Mallory enjoys handing out jobs for other guild members to complete.[1]
These rare treasures are placed on or near the Guildmaster's desk next to the Guild treasury in The Ragged Flagon - Cistern, by the Crown of Barenziah.
The Dragonborn must forge the numbers and information of a business ledger of a business in Skyrim, without getting caught by the store proprietors.
The Dragonborn is tasked with stealing a specific item from a citizen of Skyrim, without getting caught doing so.
The Dragonborn must steal goods from a city unnoticed and without killing anyone, meaning to maintain stealth at all costs.
Delvin Mallory will be present during the Dragonborn's initiation as Guild Master.
The dragonborn will be tasked with bringing the Amulet from Amaund Motierre to Delvin for appraisal and he'll provide a Letter of Credit to take back to Astrid to confirm the contract is ready to be carried out.
The Dragonborn must frame the captain of a trade ship for possessing banned items because he cheated Erikur, Jarl Elisif the Fair's thane and the Thieves Guild's client.
The Dragonborn must assist with the escape of Arn, the friend of wealthy Whiterun resident Olfrid Battle-Born, leader of Clan Battle-Born, who is sentenced to be executed back in Solitude once word reaches Whiterun of his crimes.
The Dragonborn must recover a silver mold for Endon, a silversmith in the city of Markarth to solidify the Thieves Guild's influence in The Reach, from the bandit hideout of Pinewatch.
The Dragonborn must disrupt the operations of a rival criminal organization, the all-Altmer Summerset Shadows to maintain the eminence of the Thieves Guild and help Torsten Cruel-Sea get back a valued piece of jewelry that belonged to his late daughter.
As a friend of Astrid (he makes friendly comments on Astrid after she directs the Dragonborn to meet Delvin as part of ""The Silence Has Been Broken""), and the Dark Brotherhood, he often takes fine jewelry and items on credit, when contracts pay the Brotherhood with them instead of gold. When Amaund Motierre employs the Dark Brotherhood to assassinate Emperor Titus Mede II, he pays with an amulet of the Elder Council. Astrid sends the Listener to speak with Delvin at The Ragged Flagon to receive credit for the amulet. Although suspicious of how the Brotherhood came to acquire the amulet, he willingly accepts it.
When Delvin was a new member of the Thieves Guild, he attempted a robbery in an unspecified tavern that resulted in him accidentally committing murder. Gallus, caring for Delvin, sent him to live with the Dark Brotherhood for several years until the heat caused from the murder died down. It was here he developed a relationship with Astrid, which ended when he left the sanctuary.
After the scene involving Mercer angering the Guild, Delvin will have a line of dialogue about betrayal, and that it's ""like the Dark Brotherhood all over again."" This could indicate he was in the Brotherhood and betrayed by them, or even by Astrid herself, though it leaves much to speculation because there will be no other discussion on the matter. Astrid will only smugly reveal that they have a ""history."" It could even indicate that he, like Astrid herself, felt betrayed when the Night Mother did not choose a new Listener and let the Brotherhood decline.
I've finished that special Windhelm job. ""Torsten was gratified the death of his daughter was avenged and the heirloom was returned. At this very moment, he's layin' the groundwork for the Guild to reestablish itself in Windhelm. Burnin' that banner was a nice touch, too. Should send a clear message to to the Summerset Shadows that we're a force to be reckoned with. I think you'll find that the Guild is beginnin' to grow. We've had a merchant move into the space right outside the flagon. It's nice to shake the cobwebs off and get things rollin' again. Keep this up and I can see a bounty headed our way.""
I've finished that special Markarth job. ""I hear Endon's quite pleased to have his merchandise back. He's a powerful ally in Markarth. Should help the Guild regain a foothold in the west. We're still growin' by leaps and bounds thanks to you. Another merchant's just moved into the space outside the Flagon. You're a natural. Never seen anything' like it. We've got a long way to go, but don't let that bother you... it's a lot farther than we've been in years.""
I've finished that special Solitude job. ""Erikur assures me that Captain Volf will spend pretty much the rest of his life clapped in irons. Best of all, he's also pledged to open doors for us in Solitude and to get things rollin' again. Success means that the Guild is gettin' stronger. We've picked up another merchant and a new recruit. Bein' a thief is like a second skin for you, ain't it? Never seen anythin' like it. If you don't watch out, you might even earn Vex's respect.

/wiki/Dengeir_of_Stuhn,"Dengeir of Stuhn is a Nord who is the former Jarl of Falkreath, and is currently a thane of the Hold. He will retake his former position as Jarl if the Stormcloaks take Falkreath
When spoken to, he comes off as highly suspicious of nearly everyone. In fact, he even suspects his maid of passing off information about him. Even if Dengeir becomes Jarl, he is still as paranoid as before.
Dengeir of Stuhn lives in Dengeir's House in Falkreath. His brother Thadgeir also lives with him as well as Tekla, his faithful maid. Dengeir is also Jarl Siddgeir's uncle.
He once ruled Falkreath as Jarl, but his nephew Siddgeir has taken over the position as Jarl and Dengeir now serves the Jarl's Court as a Thane.
His story of why he was deposed as Jarl differs radically from his nephew's. He believes he was asked to step down when he took sides with the Stormcloaks and that it was, in fact, an Imperial plot to oust him from his seat of power. Dengeir states that he began noticing that Imperial spies were everywhere amongst the people of Falkreath, keeping tabs on and influencing everyone from the shadows.
When Dengeir found out about this, the spies made a few well placed bribes and the next thing he knew, the Nobles were calling for a new Jarl. Siddgeir, who is ever willing to please the Empire, was then named in his place. However, Siddgeir states that Dengeir had become too frail in his old age to continue as Jarl.
Dengeir needs help in retrieving a note, possibly destined for Imperial hands, from Lod's House.
Sometime after completing the first task, Dengeir will ask for help with another. He explains that a nearby grave has been dug up and it is thought to be the work of gravediggers. He states that it was his ancestor, Vighar who is a vampire and has now been freed from his coffin after his grave's wardstone was stolen. He requests assistance in dispatching this foe and saving his family's reputation before Vighar's condition is revealed. If the Civil War questline has been completed and Dengeir is now Jarl, this quest becomes unavailable.
If the Stormcloak quest ""Rescue from Fort Neugrad"" is completed, Dengeir will become the Jarl of Falkreath once more. When asked why he supports the Stormcloaks, he states that, ""Some emperor in Cyrodiil does not know what's best for Skyrim and should not dictate how her people should live."" He also states that he is ""no fool"" and knows that Ulfric Stormcloak is ""selfish and power-hungry"" but that he is the devil he knows (as opposed to the emperor).
Here's Lod's letter. ""What's this? Some kind of code? ""Need as much iron ore as you can dig up...."" He's not spying, but it's clear the Empire is making Lod smith up more swords and armor for them. Good work. Take this.""

Derkeethus is a miner of Goldenrock Mine, in Darkwater Crossing. He is mentioned by Sondas Drenim, who said: ""Those falls... dangerous place. Derkeethus thought he could find some good fish in the pools. Haven't heard from him in a long while."" indicating that he is missing. Hrefna also says to the Dragonborn that he used to take her diving deep in the river, and that she misses him.
If one speaks to the residents of Darkwater Crossing, they will mention that Derkeethus explored the pools above the falls, and that he has not been heard from in a long time. One will discover Darkwater Pass if the Dragonborn travels to the spot mentioned.
After freeing him, he can be recruited as a follower. If not, Derkeethus will eventually return to Darkwater Crossing.
Initially after finding Derkeethus, he is dressed as a miner, even with a pickaxe. Any armor put on Derkeethus will be overridden by his initial gear (miner's clothes, boots). This will be changed with the installation of Dawnguard however, and he will now wear any armor given to him.
His highest skills are Light Armor and Archery, but has some skill in Block, One-Handed, and Sneak. He will dual wield a one-handed weapon with his pickaxe but favors the bow.

After the uniting of each couple, Dinya Balu must be spoken to in order to receive another section of the quest.
She also gives a miscellaneous quest in which the Dragonborn must distribute The Warmth of Mara within Riften. To complete this, the Dragonborn must talk to twenty different Riften residents and give them The Warmth of Mara leaflets.

Dirge is considered impolite. If the Dragonborn asks about his name, he explains that it is ""the last thing you hear before they put you in the ground,"" and then asks if they have a problem with his name. He can be persuaded or intimidated for a bottle of Black-Briar Mead. He can also be asked about The Ratway Warrens and Esbern during ""A Cornered Rat.""

If it is one of the Dragonborn's first times inside The Ragged Flagon, dialogue options will not show when interacted with, instead he will just threaten the Dragonborn with death, in only a couple of different sentences.
If the Dragonborn is being chased by a character or any Riften Guards, they will follow him into the Thieves Guild, and if they then go into the Ragged Flagon, where Dirge can be found, the entire Thieves Guild will then begin to attack the intruders.

He was the most apprehensive of the four about the dangers of the ruins and is the first one to leave the group. He was killed shortly after parting ways from the other three, though it is unknown how he was killed.

/wiki/Drevis_Neloren,"Drevis Neloren is a Dunmer mage at the College of Winterhold. 
Drevis serves as a merchant for the college, and he is also the Master-level trainer of Illusion magic and sells advanced spells from that school.
He is often found in either the Hall of Countenance (where he sleeps from 12 AM until morning) or in The Arcanaeum. He, like Tolfdir, holds and leads lectures, which are held in the Hall of the Elements.
Upon first speaking to Drevis, he will ask the Dragonborn if they can see him, because as he is a Master at Illusion he subsequently thinks he is invisible. Even though he can be seen at all times, the Dragonborn can still choose to say they don't see him.
As part of a miscellaneous side quest, Drevis asks the Dragonborn to wear Mystic Tuning Gloves and help him cleanse many spots around the college. At each spot, the Dragonborn receives several empty Soul Gems of various qualities or an active effect called Fortify Magicka of +25 or +100 for two hours.
Reaching Master-level in Illusion, the Dragonborn seeks out Drevis for additional training. Drevis sends the Dragonborn to collect four ancient tomes containing advanced Illusion spells.
Drevis Neloren has been kidnapped and taken to Tolvald's Cave. The Companions asks the Dragonborn to rescue him and escort him back to College of Winterhold.
Is there any College business I can assist with? ""There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful. The various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted, and need cleansing. The magical energies underneath the College still require purification. Your assistance would be most useful.""

Elenwen appears at the Greybeards' peace conference in High Hrothgar, assuring her presence is only to ensure that the White-Gold Concordat is upheld. Ulfric Stormcloak asks her to leave, claiming she has no place in Skyrim's politics, and the presence of a Talos-hater is a deliberate provocation against him. General Tullius allows the Dragonborn to decide whether or not she stays. Her involvement in the following discussions is minimal; her presence has no real impact on the conference.

/wiki/Elisif_the_Fair,"Elisif the Fair is the Jarl of Haafingar and the widow of High King Torygg, the last elected High King of Skyrim prior to the Stormcloak Rebellion. While Elisif is the head of court at her palace in Solitude, the provincial capital of Skyrim as a whole alongside being the hold capital of Haafingar, the majority of her courtly duties are handled by her steward, Falk Firebeard. Bolgeir Bearclaw serves as her Housecarl, while Bryling and Erikur serve as her Thanes.
Elisif can be found in the Blue Palace located in the southeast of Solitude. The palace stands directly across and down the street from Castle Dour, the headquarters of the Imperial military forces in Skyrim.
It was after Torygg's death, at the hand of Ulfric Stormcloak, that Elisif became the Jarl of Solitude and Haafingar Hold, and following her assumption to power in Solitude, Elisif would work in close cooperation with the Third Empire against Ulfric Stormcloak and the Stormcloak Rebellion. The true reasons for Elisif's support of the Empire are debatable, but factors involved included the fact that her husband Torygg served under the Emperor (though Torygg's own loyalty is debatable), and the fact that Solitude serves as the base of Imperial military power in Skyrim at the time of the Stormcloak Rebellion, especially as it is the provincial capital of Skyrim as a whole alongside its duties as the capital of Haafingar Hold.
In turn, the Empire works closely with Jarl Elisif in its attempts to squash the Stormcloak Rebellion. This Imperial support, along with Elisif's marriage to the last High King, makes Elisif the most likely candidate for the position of monarch should the Empire succeed in ending the Stormcloak Rebellion. However, Elisif's lack of experience and total dependence on Imperial support, specifically with regards to General Tullius, seems to imply that, should she become High Queen, Elisif will be greatly under the control of the Empire, like her husband under the Emperor.
An outspoken supporter of the Empire, Elisif is a Jarl whose court views are to keep Skyrim as a province of the Empire of Tamriel. Viewing the Stormcloak Rebellion as a blight upon the face of Skyrim, Elisif gives no explicit indication of any dissatisfaction with the Empire.
With regard to religious views, Elisif states that she does not worship Talos. However, she nonetheless asks the Dragonborn to deliver Torygg's War Horn to a Shrine of Talos near Whiterun so that her late husband might have the funerary rites which he would have wanted, High King Torygg having been a worshipper of Talos.
Elisif at the conclusion of the Battle for Solitude.
If the Dragonborn sides with the Stormcloaks during the Civil War and captures Solitude, killing General Tullius and Legate Rikke, Elisif agrees to swear fealty to Ulfric Stormcloak with little resistance, but whether she does so out of personal interest or militaristic coercion is not entirely clear. In any case, Ulfric's choice to garrison a number of his Stormcloaks in Solitude, following a Stormcloak victory in the ""Battle for Solitude,"" seems to imply that Elisif will only act as the Jarl of Solitude as far as Ulfric allows. She also holds no anger against the Dragonborn personally, rather regret that she has lost her claim to the throne.
Elisif entrusts the Dragonborn with Torygg's War Horn and tasks them to take it to a remote shrine of Talos.
There is room for another Thane in the court, but before Elisif can give the Dragonborn this title they must be known throughout the hold. Once known among the people of Haafingar and purchasing Proudspire Manor as their new home in Solitude from Falk, Elisif will be able to proclaim the Dragonborn Thane of Solitude, awarding them the Blade of Haafingar.
Elisif forbids the Burning of King Olaf, a locally celebrated festival which involves the burning of an effigy, as the death of her husband has left her sensitive to this type of public defamation. The Dragonborn is able to convince her to allow the Bards College to hold this festival should the Dragonborn find and retrieve King Olaf's Verse. This quest can be initiated by speaking with Viarmo, the headmaster of the college.
Taarie, a tailor at Radiant Raiment in Solitude, sends the Dragonborn to Elisif, sporting one of their many outfits. The Dragonborn is tasked with receiving Elisif's opinion on the clothes. She receives the garments well, ordering the Dragonborn to return with promises of purchasing several gowns from the tailors in the future.
Elisif can be asked to create a distraction if ""The Man Who Cried Wolf"" was already completed. She will accuse Razelan of defying her authority, believing that the Dragonborn asked for the distraction as a joke to someone else.
Elisif can be found attending the public reception of the wedding of Vittoria Vici and Asgeir Snow-Shod at the Temple of the Divines in Solitude. Like the others, she will be horrified when Vittoria is murdered, but won't retaliate like the Snow-Shods if the Dragonborn is discovered or Veezara appears to deal with Vittoria's Penitus Oculatus bodyguard, opting to flee instead. Asgeir's death only reminds her of the recent murder of her own husband by Ulfric.

Eltrys seems to have a relationship with Rhiada. This is indicated by both dialogue with  Thonar Silver-Blood and the presence of the key to Eltrys' room in Rhiada's inventory.

The Dragonborn will need to speak to Enmon, the father of Fjotra, to find the next Sybil of Dibella for the temple in Markarth.
Enmon is one of the quest characters that can be ""reverse pickpocketed"" and exploited to follow the Dragonborn throughout Skyrim along with a follower of his or her choice. Enmon and Maurice Jondrelle can die in their quests, and they along with Brother Verulus are weak allies when first met. However, they all can be much stronger by giving them any tempered, enchanted heavy armor. Just like Brother Verulus, Enmon can be commanded to do tasks and therefore can equip a full set of enchanted Daedric armor. He can be given any light chest armor as well.

During this quest, the Dragonborn must retrace their steps after a night of drunken escapades caused by Sam Guevenne, the alter ego of the Daedric Prince Sanguine. This quest brings the Dragonborn to an angry Ennis, who berates the Dragonborn for stealing his prize-winning goat, Gleda, and selling it to a giant. The Dragonborn must then persuade or intimidate him or attempt to get Gleda back from the giant by any means necessary.
Reldith ""The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the Hold."" Ennis ""Maybe we should start selling the soil along with the dung. We could make a tidy profit.""

/wiki/Enthir,"Enthir is a Bosmer sorcerer and merchant found at the College of Winterhold, and has connections to the Thieves Guild in Skyrim.
Enthir presents himself as a rather shady figure: he calls himself the ""guy that can do things."" He is often referred to in quests around the College of Winterhold. He can usually be found either in the Hall of Attainment on the second floor toward the northwest in his room or at The Frozen Hearth in Winterhold.
He was close friends with Gallus Desidenius, the former guildmaster of the Thieves Guild. He describes their first meeting as an amusing anecdote, as Gallus broke into his laboratory and, rather than flee from Enthir or fight him, made an interesting comment on his notes. It ended up with them having a long discussion and the two of them becoming friends.[1]
Enthir is involved with two parts of this questline: Firstly he sends the Dragonborn to recover the Staff of Tandil in exchange for the Warped Soul Gem ordered by Arniel Gane. Later, after a package goes missing (the unique dagger Keening), a delivery that Enthir insists was organized by Arniel, he directs the Dragonborn to the location where the courier was last seen.
Onmund requests that the Dragonborn ask Enthir to return his Amulet, and should they be unable to persuade him to do so, Enthir will offer to return the item if the Dragonborn recovers a staff (the Grand Staff of Charming) from a radiant location. Upon the successful recovery of the staff, Enthir will return the amulet.
The Dragonborn is sent by Karliah to speak with Enthir in order to translate Gallus's journal. Enthir identifies that the text within it was written in the Falmer language, but as he is unable to translate it, he sends the Dragonborn to Calcelmo, self-defined expert on the Dwemer and court-mage of Markarth to have it deciphered. After the Dragonborn collects a rubbing of a Falmer deciphering tool located within Calcelmo's Tower, Enthir successfully translates the journal, offering his services as a fence in return.
Enthir sells Black Soul Gems for around 800–1,000 . He sells other mage equipment, such as spell tomes, staves and robes, at much higher prices than other merchants. He also sells Daedra Hearts, which are useful for Alchemy and creating Daedric armor and weapons. He restocks his items every two days.
After ""Hard Answers"" has been completed, he will sell his wares at regular prices. He will only act as a fence when outside the College's buildings or in the town of Winterhold. Be warned: if the Dragonborn attacks him, the Thieves Guild will require a compensation.
I understand you have something of Onmund's. He wants it back. ""I've already made it very clear that all of my trades are final.""

/wiki/Eola,"Eola is a Breton cannibal who is initially encountered in the Hall of the Dead in Markarth. She leads a coven of cannibals who worship the Daedric Prince Namira as their high priestess.
Eola will not appear until the Dragonborn speaks to Brother Verulus about investigating the hall of the dead. Prior to this, she will not be within Skyrim. 
Eola can be recruited as a follower after clearing Reachcliff Cave and agreeing to join her cannibalistic cult. She is a powerful mage adept in the Destruction and Alteration schools, typically using lightning-based spells while also being capable of summoning Daedra and re-animating the bodies of slain enemies in combat.
When dismissed as a follower, she will return to Reachcliff Cave and sit at the head of the cannibal table. However, if she is dismissed outside the Reachcliff Cave Secret Entrance, she will take the much longer overland route to the main entrance, risking her death from bears and dragons along the way. Dismissing her inside the cave will prevent this.
Eola is recruitable to the Blades once she becomes a follower. With the addition of Hearthfire, she can also become a Steward.
Eola uses the Nightblade class template (Destruction and Alteration magic with high sneaking abilities and a preference for one-handed weapons and light armor). Eola is effective at a distance or close range and can sneak without attracting attention. When well equipped she can hold her own and is a great follower due to her versatility.
Eola usually begins by summoning a flame atronach to her aid, casting Fireballs or Lightning, then re-animating the bodies of slain enemies. When her Magicka runs out, she prefers one-handed weapons, staves, and will even use a bow. Eola is proficient with one-handed weapons and may also wield two weapons at once.confirmation needed She likes to use her magic to augment her combat abilities.

/wiki/Eorlund_Gray-Mane,"Eorlund Gray-Mane is a Nord blacksmith and is widely considered to be the best blacksmith in Skyrim, forging weapons and armor for The Companions at the Skyforge in Whiterun. However, he is not a direct member of the Companions. Eorlund can usually be found working at the Skyforge, just north of Jorrvaskr, up the stairs. He is normally seen crafting Skyforge Weapons for The Companions.
As a member of the Gray-Mane family, he strongly supports the Stormcloaks. If the Stormcloaks capture Whiterun, Eorlund's brother, Vignar Gray-Mane, becomes Jarl. Eorlund's children are Avulstein, Thorald, and Olfina.
Eorlund is married to Fralia Gray-Mane, who can be found at her market stall in the Plains District of Whiterun selling any jewelry Eorlund crafts. According to Fralia, the only topic Eorlund will talk about is the Skyforge, though she mentions that the Dragonborn might be able to get him to talk about ""those dung-sniffing Battle-Borns.""
After passing the trial and joining The Companions, Eorlund crafts a special Skyforge weapon of the Dragonborn's choice.
He is the master trainer of Smithing in the base game, and can train up to level 90. The Dragonborn must complete the first ""Take Up Arms"" quest for the Companions to receive training.
After Vilkas tests the Dragonborn's arm in the training area behind Jorrvaskr, he sends the Dragonborn to Eorlund Gray-Mane in the Skyforge to get his sword sharpened. Eorlund mentions that his wife is in grieving (probably a reference to his missing son Thorald; see Missing in Action) and that he needs to get back to her, he asks a favor of the Dragonborn: to bring Aela back her shield. Completion of this task makes the Dragonborn part of the Jorrvaskr faction, and enables Eorlund Gray-Mane as a trainer.
Eorlund informs the Dragonborn that the Skyforge has become ""young"" once again. This specifically alludes to the option to craft Nord Hero Weapons and Ancient Nord Armor at the Skyforge.
After Kodlak's funeral, Eorlund will ask the Dragonborn to give him the collected fragments of Wuuthrad so he can prepare them for mounting. Then, after tasking the Dragonborn with retrieving the final piece of Wuuthrad in Kodlak's personal chambers, Eorlund will thank the Dragonborn and tell him/her that the Circle is waiting for them in The Underforge. After the conversation in the Underforge, Eorlund will appear with Wuuthrad, fully reforged, which he passes to the player.

/wiki/Erandur,"Erandur is a Dunmer healer who can be found at the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar. Early in his life, he was inducted into a cult dedicated to the Daedric Prince Vaermina. After he grew up, he left the order, changing his name from Brother Casimir to Erandur, and dedicating his life to Mara. He is also a temporary protagonist during the Daedric Quest: Waking Nightmare.
During the Civil War, the Dragonborn may have assisted him with eradicating Vaermina's cult, after several citizens of Dawnstar fell victim to gruesome nightmares. After, he may have joined the Dragonborn as a follower, potentially becoming recruited into The Blades.
Erandur was recruited into the cult of Vaermina as a young elf and was not allowed to socialize with people outside of the cult, which led to him having what he calls ""no childhood to speak of."" At some point, Erandur was a member of the Bards College, before his affiliation with Vaermina was discovered.
He grew up within the cult and lived in Nightcaller Temple until several Orcish invaders, tormented by nightmares left behind by Vaermina, attacked the temple. Realizing that they could not hope to defeat the Orcs, and desperate to keep the Skull of Corruption safe, the priests decided to release ""the Miasma,"" a mist of sorts that puts people into a deep sleep. Erandur, then named Brother Casimir, was the one to release it, but before the miasma could take him, he fled, leaving his fellow priests to die. It was an act that haunts him to this day.
Erandur dedicated his life to Mara after his affiliation with Vaermina.
He spent a few years wandering Skyrim until he was taken in by a priest of Mara. He decided to become a priest of Mara himself, although he did have trouble adjusting from the dark and brutal ways of Vaermina to the kind and loving ways of Mara. His fellow priests patiently helped him through the process, and now he has gone back to Dawnstar, where he has to deal with Vaermina's influence on the people.
Erandur, praying to Mara for assistance with overcoming Vaermina's temptation.
Speaking with the Jarl of Dawnstar, the Dragonborn learns of a fatal condition pervading the citizens of Dawnstar. Several fall asleep indefinitely, while others complain of dreadful nightmares.
Finding Erandur in the Windpeak Inn, the Dragonborn agrees to follow him to Nightcaller Temple and end the streak of nightmares. There, it is revealed that the Dragonborn must enter the memories of Erandur, using Vaermina's Torpor, an alchemical draught, which reveals Erandur as a former Vaermina cultist. Succeeding, Erandur and the Dragonborn proceed toward the altar of the temple, hoping to destroy the Skull of Corruption and end the nightmares occurring in Dawnstar.
The two are attacked by Veren and Thorek, priests of Vaermina, who accuse Erandur of fleeing from the battle and not falling into a paralytic sleep. Defeating them, the Dragonborn has the option to allow Erandur to perform a ritual and destroy the Skull of Corruption, or take it for themselves. Before making the decision, Vaermina calls out to the Dragonborn, promising great power if he or she chooses to slay Erandur.

Erikur can be used as a distraction during the party, if the Dragonborn promises to have Brelas ""meet"" with him in his quarters later. Whether or not the Dragonborn does this, Erikur provides the distraction.
Gisli is his resentful sister, who lives with him at their house. She runs errands for him and frequently insults him because of his rude personality. Erikur also has a rivalry with Bryling.
Erikur appears at the Thalmor Embassy during the party, and can be used as a distraction.
Erikur is the client for this Thieves Guild quest. After being cheated by the captain of the Dainty Sload, Erikur contracts the Thieves Guild to frame him for possession of the illegal drug Balmora Blue.
Killing him prior to the quest will render it impossible to complete. By extension, the achievement ""One with The Shadows"" cannot be collected with him dead.
Killing Erikur causes hired thugs to come to a city that the Dragonborn is in shortly after, and the thugs drop a Contract. The letter tells the Dragonborn that his sister, Gisli, paid the thugs. Entering Solitude after this opens special dialogue with Gisli. In some cases, the Dragonborn may receive a letter from Gisli saying, ""We both know you killed him. Thank you for killing him, he will not be missed.""
Killing him may also cause his housecarl Melaran to send a letter of thanks to the Dragonborn.

He also has the title of Blades Archivist and knows a great deal about the nature of the Dragon Crisis in Skyrim. He is closely associated with Delphine, another Blade operative.

Faendal is one of the followers that can become a member of the Blades.
With the addition of Hearthfire, Faendal is one of the followers that can become a steward for one of the Dragonborn's homes.
Faendal's House is located in Riverwood. Sometimes Faendal will not leave his house, leaving the door in an unlocked state. To fix this, re-enter and try again. It is possible to pickpocket Faendal's key, or if he is a follower, it may be taken from his inventory.
After taking Faendal on as a Follower, it is possible to receive free Archery training. Purchase the next training level up from Faendal, then speak with him to open the trade option. Take back the gold paid for training. This can be repeated up to five times per level, up to level 50 in Archery.
As with any trainer, money given to him can be pickpocketed back. The total value of gold affects the success rate, as does the Cutpurse perk. This is another way to train both Archery and Pickpocket, but can only be used when he is not a follower, as the Pickpocket option is not available for followers.
Another way to steal from him safely is to reverse-pickpocket a paralyze poison into his inventory (which requires the Pickpocket perk, Poisoned). Wait in Sneak mode while he is paralyzed, then once the effect runs out and he starts standing up, pickpocket him, and he will not notice anything being taken from him.
Faendal's house has an Apprentice level lock. To raise lockpicking, the key to his house will need to be returned, if it was taken. With Faendal following, pick the lock to his house, then go back outside. He will lock it again, resetting it so it may be picked again.
Faendal seems to have a lawful disposition; when trespassing in residences, he will occasionally say, ""You're not supposed to be in here"" and he will refuse to enter dialogue and take orders until leaving the area. If ordered to attack a civilian or hold guard, he will say, ""No. Not for you. Not for anyone."" Also, if the Dragonborn enters combat with Hold Guards or Imperial Soldiers, he will join them in attacking the Dragonborn. This does not occur if he is hit by the Imperial Soldiers, as this will turn him hostile towards them.
Faendal will not search through a dead body, even if the body is from a bandit, dragon or other creatures. He will reply with ""Can't do that. Sorry.""
Faendal is competent with bows but often prefers to use daggers and swords if he has them. He will use the most damaging bow in his inventory at long range, the most damaging blade available at close range, and while at a mid-range (provided no obstacles) he tends to use any weapon with the highest damage.",Faendal,Male Even Toned,MaleEvenToned,Wood Elf,Male,,78988,78976

/wiki/Falion_(Skyrim),"Falion is a Redguard mage in Skyrim who resides in Morthal. Before settling in the town, Falion was the Conjuration master at the College of Winterhold, a position now held by his former pupil Phinis Gestor. He left because he hated to have to report to Savos Aren, the Arch-Mage of the College, as well as disliking ""where the College is headed,"" as Phinis says. He is also the brother of Morthal's innkeeper, Jonna.
Due to Conjuration's association with Necromancy, the people of the town accuse him of all sorts of wrongdoings, such as killing children and eating the hearts of the dead. Falion takes care of an adopted orphan, Agni, and is also teaching her the ways of magic. He can be found wandering around Morthal or at his house.
Falion is a Master level Conjuration trainer and also sells spell tomes from all magic schools and Black Soul Gems.
Upon first encountering Falion, he seems annoyed, ranting to the Dragonborn. He states that people have made false accusations towards him, although he calms down if he sees that the Dragonborn has no intention of harassing him. He then offers training in Conjuration along with some of his background knowledge, as well as selling spell tomes, mage robes, and soul gems.
After speaking to Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone upon entering Morthal, she mentions that strange rumors are circulating in regard to Falion's activities at night. Falion has a conversation with his adopted daughter, where she claims to have had bad dreams of him fighting monsters while she slept. If the Dragonborn then waits outside of Falion's house until 01:00 AM, Falion can be seen walking into the marshes. Since Falion's specialty is Conjuration, he leads the Dragonborn to the Summoning Stones. Falion is startled when asked what he is doing there. 200  can be gained if the Dragonborn threatens to tell the Jarl. However, if one agrees not to mention his behavior to others, Falion will simply thank them and like them more.
Head back to the Jarl of Morthal and inform her that Falion is being suspicious and she will say that she had a vision of this. From this point, she closely monitors his behavior, following him around everywhere, only leaving her post to eat or sleep.
Speaking with any innkeeper or member of the Dawnguard DG while afflicted with vampirism causes them to send the vampire to Falion. He agrees to cure their condition if one filled Black Soul Gem is brought to him. The Black Soul Gem must be filled with the Grand Soul of a dead humanoid mortal; anything else will not work. Upon doing so, he leads the vampire to the Summoning Stones where their affliction is cured. The ritual can be performed an unlimited number of times to cure a vampiric condition. If the Dragonborn does not have a Black Soul Gem, Falion will sell the Dragonborn an empty one, for around 500–700 . Occasionally, Falion can be pickpocketed for a Black Soul Gem, though the value of the gem makes it difficult.
Why set up shop in Morthal? ""As anyone will tell you, Morthal can be a dangerous place. My... talents... are useful here. I help maintain order, even if it goes unnoticed.""

Traveling to the Blue Palace, the Dragonborn learns that Wolfskull Cave is plagued with creatures. While the Jarl is not overly concerned about this, Falk promises to pay the Dragonborn to purge the cave of its denizens. The Dragonborn returns to reveal that the cave was crawling with necromancers and draugr, with the necromancers trying to summon the Wolf Queen back from the dead.
A short time after the cave has been cleared, Falk sends a courier with a letter expressing his concern about the Necromancers at Wolfskull Cave and requesting a meeting. At the meeting, he directs the Dragonborn to Styrr who says that Potema must be destroyed in her catacombs beneath Solitude before she can amass an army of undead, including draugr and vampires, to take over Skyrim.
Falk, as steward, is also responsible for selling the home in Solitude, Proudspire Manor, and all related decorations and upgrades.

Nirya accuses Faralda of being jealous and antagonistic towards her, although Faralda shows no personal animosity in return, and in fact does not even mention her in conversation. However, if the Dragonborn kills Nirya, Faralda will contact the Dragonborn in a letter, telling them Nirya will not be missed and that she will not tell anyone who killed her. However, witnessing the murder of any other member of the College leads to suspension and earns a 1,000  bounty.
Faralda will greet the Dragonborn when they first approach the college, explaining that outsiders may not enter without permission. To become a member, the Dragonborn must demonstrate magical aptitude by performing a spell of Faralda's choosing. If the Dragonborn does not know the appropriate spell, she will offer to sell the tome for it for 30 , and mentions that other merchants who sell spell tomes may have it; however her price is less than the base price of other merchants.
Alternatively, if the Dragonborn is far enough along in the main quest, they can gain entry by displaying mastery of the Voice.
Following Tolfdir's advice to defend Winterhold against the magic anomalies released by Ancano, Faralda and Arniel Gane assist the Dragonborn in battle. Faralda dual-wields Thunderbolt spells and casts Ebonyflesh to repel melee attacks.

/wiki/Farengar_Secret-Fire,"Farengar Secret-Fire
Farengar Secret-Fire, commonly referred to throughout the game as Farengar, serves as the court wizard for Jarl Balgruuf the Greater at Dragonsreach in Whiterun where he conducts studies regarding magic and dragons.
In general, Farengar is friendly enough to the Dragonborn; cooperative without quirks, though sometimes more than a little condescending. He is scripted for the archetypal absent-minded professor, being far more focused on abstract thought and scientific curiosity than to prefer practical interpersonal communication or stagnant common sense. He treats the Skyrim Civil War with overall distaste, seeing it as an obstacle to progress, but his personal loyalty and respect for Jarl Balgruuf transcends such things.
Prior to the Dragonborn's arrival at Dragonsreach, Farengar regarded dragons as hypothetical, mythical phenomena. He is fascinated upon learning their existence and expresses wishes to see one in person; however, his wish is denied by Jarl Balgruuf on the grounds that it is too dangerous and that Farengar is needed alive in Dragonsreach in order to continue researching ways to counter a dragon attack. 
Later, during Odahviing's capture, Farengar attempts to perform some tests for his research, but is sent running by a blast of fire from the angered dragon.
Farengar's study is attached to the main hall of Dragonsreach. He sells spell tomes and has an alchemy lab and arcane enchanter. Additionally, Farengar sells enchanting supplies and is himself an enchanter.
Arriving in Whiterun to inform the Jarl of the dragon attack at Helgen, the Dragonborn is asked by Farengar to retrieve the Dragonstone from Bleak Falls Barrow. It is possible that the Dragonborn already got the stone while helping Lucan Valerius recover The Golden Claw that was stolen from him.
Upon returning to Dragonsreach, Farengar will thank the Dragonborn for retrieving the Dragonstone, noting that the Jarl or Proventus will see to a reward. He is then summoned by Irileth, to which the Dragonborn is invited to come along as well. After Balgruuf sends his Housecarl and the Dragonborn to the Western Watchtower, Farengar expresses a desire to see a live dragon, although Balgruuf denies this since he is already risking Irileth for the mission.
When the Dragonborn traps Odahviing in Dragonsreach, Farengar asks if he can run some tests on him and does so even when Odahviing says, ""Begone mage, do not test my promise to the Dovahkiin."" Eventually, despite Irileth warning him that what he is doing is a bad idea, Odahviing lets out a stream of fire that sends Farengar running from the room as Balgruuf reprimands him.
Asking Farengar about his wares can spark the ""Visit College of Winterhold"" quest. Farengar also asks the Dragonborn to deliver frost salts to Arcadia at Arcadia's Cauldron in Whiterun. When successfully delivered, Arcadia mentions the ingredients will be used to craft a Love Potion which she says she will test on Farengar, possibly joking.
The Dragonborn has the option of killing Farengar or picking his pocket to obtain a key to the room containing the Ebony Blade. It is possible to pickpocket the key from him even with a low pickpocket skill.
Stealing from him at any point may result in a contract to have hired thugs kill the Dragonborn.
If Farengar dies, either by circumstance or being murdered by the Dragonborn, he bequeaths a sum of 100  to the Dragonborn, 10 of which is removed by the Jarl as tax.

/wiki/Farkas,"Farkas is a lycanthropic Nord in Skyrim who is a member of The Circle, one of the most formidable and experienced warriors in the Companions. Like the rest of the Companions, he lives in Jorrvaskr in the Wind District of Whiterun. He is a Master-level trainer in Heavy Armor and serves as the Dragonborn's shield-brother in several of the Companions' quests. He is also one of the Companions who can assign radiant quests to the Dragonborn.
Upon completion of the Companions' main plotline, Farkas can be recruited as a follower and becomes a potential marriage candidate. He can be recruited into the Blades if the Dragonborn talks to Delphine while having him as a follower.
Farkas and his twin brother Vilkas were raised at Jorrvaskr by Jergen, who rescued them from a circle of necromancers.[1] It is unknown if he was their biological father. Jergen left to fight in the Great War but never returned.[2]
Both brothers eventually became official members of the Companions and rose to the ranks of the Circle. They were said to be the youngest members to ever join, though this may be a play on words by Vignar Gray-Mane, referring to the twins' young age during their residence at Jorrvaskr rather than the age at which their membership became official.
Farkas calls Jergen his father, and considers the Companions his family. He is especially close to his brother and follows along with his views in most situations.
Kodlak states in his journal that Farkas is ""too kindhearted"" to be Harbinger. Farkas is also the first of the Companions, apart from Kodlak, to be genuinely friendly and welcoming toward the Dragonborn when they join the order.
Vilkas jokes about Farkas being the more dim-witted of the two. Other Companions will also insult Farkas' intelligence by calling him ""icebrain""[3] or ""oaf.""[4] Farkas takes the teasing from people he likes, but states that he will punch anyone else who thinks he is not smart.
He takes great pride in his physical strength, and notes that he enjoys the added strength of his Beast Form. He prefers to resolve problems through bludgeoning and leave the thinking to others if possible. He does understand there are limits to such behavior; when sending the Dragonborn on ""Hired Muscle"" quests, he stresses the target should be beaten but not killed. He wears a random set of steel armor minus the helmet, and carries a Skyforge steel greatsword. After the quest ""Proving Honor,"" he carries an iron greatsword instead.
Before Take Up Arms and after Glory of the Dead, Farkas can be randomly encountered in the wilds of Skyrim traveling with fellow Companions Athis and Torvar. When the Dragonborn approaches Whiterun for the first time, he can be found fighting a giant at Pelagia Farm with his shield-sisters Aela the Huntress and Ria.
In this radiant quest, Farkas requires the Dragonborn to kill the leader in a radiant location.
In this radiant quest, Farkas requires the Dragonborn to brawl with a random NPC.
To test the Dragonborn's honor and skill, Skjor sends the Dragonborn to acquire a lost fragment of Wuuthrad from Dustman's Cairn. Farkas is assigned as the Dragonborn's shield-brother and observer for this quest.
During the quest, the Dragonborn is trapped behind a gate and Farkas is surrounded by Silver Hand members. He transforms into his Beast Form to slay them, and opens the gate to free the Dragonborn. After the fragment is retrieved and brought to Jorrvaskr, Farkas stands witness to the Dragonborn's honor as they are inducted into the Companions.
After Kodlak's funeral, Farkas accompanies the remaining members of the Circle to The Underforge. The decision is made for the Circle to travel to Ysgramor's Tomb and cure Kodlak's spirit of lycanthropy so Kodlak may ascend to Sovngarde.
While in the tomb, the fear of frostbite spiders that Farkas gained in Dustman's Cairn gets the better of him. He apologizes and states he will wait outside with his brother, leaving the Dragonborn and Aela to finish the quest on their own. Once the quest is complete, Farkas decides to stay at the tomb with the other Circle members for a while.
Farkas wishes to rid himself of his beast blood. To cure him, the Dragonborn must take him to Ysgramor's Tomb, throw a Glenmoril Witch Head into the fire, then kill Farkas' beast spirit.
After Farkas' beast blood is removed, the Dragonborn can speak to him again for more radiant quests. Eventually, he will have the quest Dragon Seekers for the Dragonborn, indicated by the speech option ""Is there any work to be done?""
Farkas will tell the Dragonborn of people coming to Whiterun with rumors of dragons, and how he would like to see one for himself. He will then give the Dragonborn the location of one of the Word Walls to travel to and kill the dragon located there. Once completed, he will elect to remain behind for a while so he can get the details right when he tells Vilkas of the battle.
Farkas can train up to level 90 in Heavy Armor, though his Heavy Armor skill is actually a low level.
If recruited as a follower, his services as a trainer are still available. Any gold paid can be taken out of his inventory afterwards, effectively making the training free.",Farkas,Male Brute,MaleBrute,Nord,Male,,108179,108178

After recovering an Elder Scroll from Blackreach, the Dragonborn used it atop the Throat of the World. The scroll opened a window into the memory of Felldir's battle against Alduin, where the Dragonborn learned the Dragonrend shout and witnessed the events that brought Alduin into the Fourth Era.

When asked about himself, he says he was a ""child prodigy."" Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three, resurrecting corpses by seven, and accidentally burnt down his family home by the age of thirteen due to some lightning that got ""out of control"" but he says nobody should worry, because he mastered all magic just after that happened.
He then went on to teach at the College of Winterhold for two years, but left due to the fact that none of the mages there were ""truly appreciating the Destruction school.""

He commands the Stormcloak army when planning assaults on Imperial cities and forts. Galmar sees that all new recruits are properly outfitted with Stormcloak Armor and have taken the Oath.[1]
He takes a no-mercy approach to the Civil War, and firmly believes that those who are unwilling to fight the Empire deserve to die. He is also deeply respected by his men for his valor, leadership, and concern for their well-being. He firmly believes that the principal duty of a Stormcloak is to be a paragon of Nordic values and a hero for the masses.[1] Galmar is fiercely loyal to his leader, Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak. The two share an informal relationship and do not stand on ceremony with each other. There is strong respect and friendship between the two.[1][2]
If spoken to in Sovngarde following the defeat of Alduin, he and Ulfric express no vengeance toward the Dragonborn, despite being enemies during the civil war questline, should the Dragonborn side with the Empire. He remarks that ""eternity is too long to hold a grudge."" However, if talked to prior to defeating Alduin, he speaks to you with hatred, saying, ""Dragonborn, even in death you dog my steps? Cursed be your name by all the sons and daughters of Skyrim!""
Galmar equips a full set of Stormcloak Officer Armor, and has an Iron Battleaxe as a weapon.

Succeeding at this, he inducts the Dragonborn into the Stormcloaks, serving as their commanding officer. All battles fought by the Dragonborn as part of the Civil War as a Stormcloak are given by Galmar, with some at the Stormcloak camps located in the holds controlled by the Imperial Legion.
If Galmar is killed during the Civil War, he can be encountered in Sovngarde.

/wiki/Gauldur,"Gauldur was a powerful Breton conjurer who lived during the First Era. He was all but erased from the annals of history by High King Harald.
As an Archmage at the beginning of the First Era, Gauldur was wise, wealthy, powerful, and honorable, so much so that he was revered throughout the North. Even the most powerful men of his time came to hear his wise words. He had three sons: Jyrik, Mikrul, and Sigdis, who were overcast by their father's shadow. As a result, they grew resentful and cruel, desiring their father's power and prestige. Jyrik, the oldest of his sons, discovered that Gauldur's power stemmed from the amulet which he wore at all times. He and his brothers conspired to kill their father and split the amulet and its power.
Gauldur's children had at last gained the power they sought, but they were cruel, evil men and used their newfound power to massacre the nearby villages. So extensive was the destruction that High King Harald sent a company of battlemages led by the Arch-Mage Geirmund to destroy them. A great battle was fought, and the brothers were defeated and made to flee the field of battle. Geirmund pursued them and killed them, eventually giving his life to defeat the last of the brothers in a duel. The amulet fragments were magically sealed, along with each brother, in the place they were defeated. Once all the dead had been buried and the amulet sealed, the High King ordered all records of Gauldur and his sons destroyed, to forever seal away the power of the amulet.
The Dragonborn discovers that after the Gauldur brothers were defeated, their tombs were sealed and they were left as undead as punishment for their betrayal, theft, and murder. It is revealed, however, that the legend survived. The book Lost Legends explains how the event began. Daynas Valen's journals and notes explain the history, as well as his plan to acquire the amulet. Unfortunately, it went horribly wrong as he was killed inside one of the ruins and his corpse was abandoned. Each brother has a Gauldur Amulet Fragment and a unique weapon in addition to a Writ of Sealing, punishing them for their crimes. Sigdis can be found in Geirmund's Hall. His weapon is the Gauldur Blackbow and his fragment increases Stamina. Jyrik can be found in Saarthal. His weapon is the Staff of Jyrik Gauldurson and his fragment increases Magicka. Mikrul can be found in Folgunthur. His weapon is the Gauldur Blackblade and his fragment increases Health. An Ancient Edict can be found at Reachwater Rock, warning adventurers and travelers to stay away from the corpses, and leave them alone to their rest. This is the place for the Dragonborn to go when reforging the amulet. After returning all three fragments and defeating all three ghosts, Gauldur's ghost will appear.

/wiki/General_Tullius_(Skyrim),"General, Provincial Governor
General Tullius is a general of the Imperial Legion and military governor of Skyrim. He can be found inside Castle Dour, in Solitude. He wears a unique piece of armor and carries an Imperial Sword.
Tullius is an Imperial originally from Cyrodiil, who has been sent to Skyrim by Emperor Titus Mede II to quell the uprising of the Stormcloaks led by Ulfric Stormcloak, Jarl of Windhelm and Eastmarch Hold.
Tullius is first seen at Helgen, presiding over the attempted execution of Ulfric for his rebellion against Imperial authority and the murder of Torygg, Skyrim's High King, having just finished speaking with Elenwen, Ambassador for the Thalmor and Aldmeri Dominion in Skyrim. However, Alduin's attack on the garrison of Helgen allowed Ulfric and the other captured rebels to escape back to Windhelm to reorganize. Tullius leads his men in an attempt to defend Helgen to allow the residents time to evacuate, but the soldiers soon are forced to abandon the town themselves when Alduin proves invincible to their arrows and magic. Surviving the attack, Tullius retreats to Castle Dour in Solitude to regroup. Alduin's interruption of Ulfric's execution ends up prolonging the Skyrim Civil War as a result.
Tullius is said to be opposed to the White-Gold Concordat and to resent the Thalmor, which he ironically has in common with his nemesis, Ulfric Stormcloak. This becomes apparent during the quest ""Season Unending,"" when Ulfric expresses vehement indignation about the Thalmor being present at the negotiations in High Hrothgar, and Tullius shows a thinly veiled agreement with Ulfric right in front of Elenwen.
Tullius often displays ignorance and disinterest about the history and culture of the Nords. However, if the Dragonborn completes the civil war questline in favor of the Empire, Tullius will mention that even though he ""will never understand these Nords,"" he has come to foster much respect for them, stating that ""The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.""
The Dragonborn first meets Tullius in Helgen where he prepares to execute a captured Ulfric Stormcloak. His execution was disrupted by an attack by Alduin.
The Dragonborn can find an Imperial Missive which details Tullius being aware that the Thalmor kidnapped Thorald Gray-Mane and has tasked Clan Battle-Born to inhibit any inquiries regarding his disappearance. Should the Dragonborn pursue diplomatic means to negotiate Thorald's release, the Thalmor guards of Northwatch Keep will deny having him as a prisoner and furthermore would refuse to release him unless by order of the Imperial Legion. The Dragonborn can ask Tullius to order his release, but he will deny them the request, stating it would cause far too many problems in regards to the uneasy peace right now between the Empire and the Dominion.
General Tullius may be one of the people attending Elenwen's party at the Thalmor Embassy.
General Tullius will lead the Imperial delegation in Season Unending, to create a temporary truce between the Stormcloaks and the Legion. He is joined by Legate Rikke, Elisif the Fair, Balgruuf the Greater if Whiterun is still under his control, and Elenwen, representing the Aldmeri Dominion to ensure the White-Gold Concordant is upheld.
Tullius will deliver a speech in an attempt to bolster his troops' courage and lead the siege on Windhelm as it is bombarded by catapult fire from the Eastmarch Imperial Camp. He and Legate Rikke will follow the player across the city until they reach the Palace of the Kings. Once there, the general demands Ulfric and his second-in-command, Galmar Stone-Fist, to surrender, making it clear that, one way or another, the general would be sending their heads back to Cyrodiil to present to the Emperor. Immediately after, a fight ensues and, once Ulfric is defeated and Galmar slain, he will tell Tullius to let the Dragonborn kill him, saying it will make for a better song, though the player may refuse and let the general have the honor. Following this, Tullius and Rikke step out and the former delivers a second speech to his troops, reassuring that the war is over and they can return home. In addition, he promises higher wages for the Legionnaires in Skyrim and pensions for the families of the fallen. If interacted with, the Imperial soldier will comment on his newly developed respect for the Nords and claims he will not return to Cyrodiil for quite some time, claiming that, despite his discomfort with Skyrim's cold weather, he has come to see the province as a home.
If the Dragonborn joins the cause of the Stormcloaks, General Tullius is defeated alongside his second-in-command, Legate Rikke. After a brief exchange of words, the Dragonborn is offered a chance by Ulfric Stormcloak to personally execute Tullius. Whether the Dragonborn defers to Ulfric to kill Tullius or ends the general's life themselves, Tullius will be killed one way or another. Before his death, Tullius concedes that Ulfric and the Stormcloaks had a point regarding the decadence of the Third Empire and the uncertain future Skyrim faces, but with his last words, he claims the Imperials are not the villains and warns Ulfric that the Civil War ultimately benefited the Thalmor and the Aldmeri Dominion the most.
""What do you think? I can't let Ulfric dictate terms to me before the negotiations even start."" (Neutral)
Here's the Jagged Crown. Legate Rikke sent me to deliver it to you. ""Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even existed. Did you run into any any trouble?""
I'd like to join the Imperial Legion. ""You... you were at Helgen. One of the prisoners. What makes you think I'm interested in someone like you for the Legion?""
I'd like to collect my earnings. ""Here's your pay. It's never enough for what we do, but war gives us warriors its own kind of benefits, doesn't it?""
(At this point, the Dragonborn can choose whether they want to kill Tullius themselves or not; following this, the Civil War ends.)

So Erikur is your brother? ""Yes. My older brother and the person you probably want to be speaking to right now. But really, since Torygg's death, Falk Firebeard wields the true power of the Jarl's court. My brother is nothing more than a pompous little fop.""

When he was a child, his father locked him within the ancient tomb for three days, during which time he survived by eating the food given to his ancestors as offerings.
He asks for help in killing a necromancer, Vals Veran, who has entered the tomb and defiled the bodies of his ancestors. He asks the Dragonborn to find his aunt, Agna, who ventured further into the tomb in Golldir's stead.
As the Dragonborn and Golldir make their way through the tomb, Agna is discovered, deceased. He will become slightly annoyed if the Dragonborn takes treasures from the tomb, but allows it, as the Dragonborn is helping him stop Vals Veran.
After clearing the tomb, the Dragonborn ends up in a chamber with Vals Veran, and his draugr army. If the Dragonborn is successful in protecting Golldir, he rewards them with coins and the key to the Hillgrund chest. Golldir returns to his aunt and will be ready to aid the Dragonborn as a follower, as long as he survives the quest with the Dragonborn.

Golldir is a warrior who specializes in heavy armor, block, and one-handed weapons (seemingly so since he starts off with a one handed axe when one first recruits him). He will use two-handed weapons as well, although his skill level is lower than his one-handed. He can also be recruited into the Blades.
If he can't be asked to follow, the Dragonborn should leave the tomb and he will be standing outside. The Dragonborn can then ask him to join.

/wiki/Grelod_the_Kind,"Grelod the Kind is an elderly Nord woman and the headmistress of the Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. Contrary to her name, she has a reputation for being an utterly cruel and heartless woman. One of her charges, Aventus Aretino, managed to escape the orphanage and employ a member of the Dark Brotherhood to have a murder contract against her satisfied.
Grelod is frequently cruel and abusive towards the children in her care. Not only does she beat them and refuse to allow their adoption, but she berates them verbally as well. Listening to Grelod's conversation with the orphans reveals she has ""extra beatings"" planned for any who ""shirk their duties."" She also states that they will never be adopted because nobody wants them, and openly calls them ""riff-raff"" to their faces.
The children are not the only ones in the orphanage who suffer from Grelod's cruelty. She also yells at her assistant, Constance Michel, from time to time, issuing mean-spirited complaints about the children and orders to deal with them. According to Constance, the people of Riften are well aware of Grelod's cruel nature; they call her ""Grelod the Kind"" out of irony.
Grelod generally wants nothing to do with the Dragonborn. Any attempts to speak to her will be roundly refused, as she is hostile to everyone.
If the Dragonborn tries to give Grelod one of Dinya Balu's The Warmth of Mara pamphlets after completing ""The Book of Love,"" Grelod will flatly turn him or her down. ""Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings.""
The Dragonborn is asked to assassinate Grelod the Kind by Aventus Aretino after being mistaken for a member of the Dark Brotherhood in the quest ""Innocence Lost."" If the Dragonborn does so, the children of the orphanage cheer and do not alert the Riften Guard.
Grelod can generally be cut down right in front of all of the children with no repercussions. If the Dragonborn lingers around too long the guards may eventually come inside – likely called by Constance Michel, who is the only person to show anything but happiness at Grelod's death by running around screaming. Once Grelod is gone, interactions with the children indicate that their lives have improved considerably: Constance is now in charge of the orphanage, and she treats her charges far more kindly than Grelod did.
It is generally not possible to speak to Grelod, though it can be done if she is confronted after receiving the contract from Aventus; the Dragonborn can even claim to be a member of the Dark Brotherhood, despite not being recruited yet. However, Grelod will not be intimidated no matter what is said.
Even when Hearthfire is installed, it is not possible to adopt children from the orphanage while Grelod the Kind lives. The Dragonborn may adopt children from elsewhere in Skyrim. Constance will remain agitated until the Dragonborn completes ""Innocence Lost"" by talking to Aventus. In order to adopt from Honorhall one is required to begin the Dark Brotherhood series of quests, regardless of whether the Dragonborn joins the Brotherhood or decides to destroy it instead.
While it is possible to assassinate her without being detected, the children enter the room and celebrate regardless. Constance will panic, even if the assassin is undetected, or even if (through the use of a Fury spell) she did the deed herself. No bounty is gained, however. Constance will remain agitated and demand that the Dragonborn leave immediately. After the Dragonborn reports back to Aretino, guards all over Skyrim will comment about it. Guards in the Rift and Riften will mention that they saw the Dragonborn coming out of there, though one will never be charged with the crime.
After Grelod is killed, the children in the orphanage all express respect for the Dark Brotherhood, as well as admiration for Aventus Aretino, for carrying out his promise. After Grelod's death, a coffin labeled ""Grelod The Kind's Coffin"" appears in Riften's Hall of the Dead.
Grelod ""Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?"" Grelod ""And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Nobody needs you, nobody wants you. That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you'll always be here, until you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world. Now, what do you all say?"" Grelod ""That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes.""
Constance ""Okay, okay. I'll deal with it."" or ""Please, just let me deal with it. Its not a problem."" or ""I'll handle it. No need to blow things out of proportion."" or ""All right. I'll take care of it.""",Grelod the Kind,Female Old Grumpy,FemaleOldGrumpy,Elder,Female,,105956,78686

/wiki/Hadvar,"Hadvar is a Nord soldier from Riverwood in Skyrim who serves in the Imperial Legion.
Hadvar was one of the soldiers on duty who escorted the Dragonborn to Helgen. If they choose to go with Hadvar when escaping Helgen, Hadvar's uncle Alvor gives them some free materials.
Hadvar thoroughly supports the Empire in regards to the civil war. He thus holds a strong resentment for the Stormcloaks, whom he sees as traitors, and often engages in combat with them.
Hadvar is shown to be a generally kind-hearted person, and shows sympathy for the Dragonborn during the execution. He reflects on the war and killing of Stormcloaks if the Dragonborn sides with the Empire expressing that he is haunted by the memory of the men he killed in war. Hadvar is one of the many Nords in Skyrim who have voluntarily joined the Imperial Legion, which even further proclaims his loyalty and fealty towards the Empire.[source?] It is shown that Hadvar fights for what he believes is good for Skyrim, and firmly believes that it is part of the Empire. In addition, he has a very calm voice, and speaks in a respectful manner.
Hadvar is first seen calling the names of the captives alongside the Imperial Captain, lining them up to be beheaded. Among those he calls include Ulfric, Ralof, one of Ulfric's soldiers from Riverwood, and Lokir, a horse thief from Rorikstead. In the confusion ensuing from Alduin's attack on Helgen, he spots the Dragonborn trying to find cover and tells them to follow him if they want to survive. If Hadvar is chosen instead of Ralof, after escaping Helgen he will take the Dragonborn to his uncle's house in Riverwood, where he will stay afterwards.
If Hadvar was followed when escaping Helgen, an option to let General Tullius know Hadvar is safe can be chosen. Though the General is glad to hear that Hadvar is alright, he can't simply let the Dragonborn join the Legion on Hadvar's vouch without verifying his survival, and thus redirects them to Legate Rikke for how to join instead.
If the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion, during this quest to retrieve the Jagged Crown from Korvanjund, Hadvar will be with Legate Rikke and her troops that are about to enter the tomb to retrieve the crown before the Stormcloaks can for Galmar Stone-Fist, having been promoted as he now wears Imperial Heavy Armor in place of the Studded Imperial Armor he was wearing back in Helgen. After the quest is done, Hadvar will be found back in Riverwood, this time staying at the Sleeping Giant Inn, still wearing his Imperial Heavy Armor he was seen in during the quest.
Hadvar will be among the Imperial Legionnaires and Whiterun Hold Guards under Legate Rikke as they protect Whiterun from Stormcloak Soldiers and Generals until the Stormcloaks are routed and the city is saved from being taken. Hadvar will listen to Jarl Balgruuf's victory speech before heading back inside with Rikke, and the surviving Legionnaires and Hold Guards.
In the Imperial Civil War quest-line the Dragonborn will meet Hadvar, who was recently promoted, and two Imperial Soldiers who are scouting a Stormcloak caravan carrying a shipment of coin and weapons. The group was sent by Legate Rikke in order to cut off the supplies of the Stormcloaks.
Hadvar will be leading the Imperial Legionnaires sent to attack Fort Kastav, the main fort in Winterhold, which also is holding several Legionnaires inside its prison as Stormcloak prisoners-of-war (POWs). After the fort is cleared of rebel forces, Hadvar will remain behind with any surviving Legionnaires to secure the fort until a garrison arrives to place it under Imperial control, allowing the Legion to claim the hold.
If Hadvar and Ralof are near each other, they will engage in some dialogue. However, this dialogue is glitched, as it is random dialogue that occurs between two Stormcloak soldiers, followed by dialogue between two Imperial Soldiers.
If Hadvar survives Helgen and the Dragonborn later joins the Imperial Legion, then Hadvar can be encountered multiple times in the civil war questline. He first appears in the quest The Jagged Crown, where he, along with Legate Rikke and other Legion soldiers, meet the Dragonborn outside Korvanjund where they then initiate an attack; eventually, they get past the Stormcloaks inside and retrieve the The Jagged Crown.
He then appears again at the Battle for Whiterun, where he is among those who fight out the rebels and save Whiterun. After the battle, Hadvar is promoted to the rank of Captain. In the quest ""Compelling Tribute,"" the Dragonborn must meet Hadvar, along with two other imperials, and they then must attack a small wagon of gold and weapons which is heavily guarded by Stormcloaks, after defeating the men Hadvar and the other two legionaries stay with the wagon while the Dragonborn reports back to Legate Rikke.
Later, in Rescue from Fort Kastav, Hadvar sends the Dragonborn into Fort Kastav through a drain leading into the prison, where they will need to rescue the imperial prisoners before coming out into the courtyard and attacking the Stormcloaks within. Afterwards, Hadvar sets up camp while the Dragonborn reports back to General Tullius.

According to her niece, Haelga is a very loose woman who slept with three men in one month. Her reputation is further justified with contextual evidence from her bedroom: a bed with shackles, a shelf full of stamina potions, a horker tusk and leather strips underneath her bed, a jar of honey and more leather strips on the dresser, The Lusty Argonian Maid Vol 1 and Vol 2, a bottle of Falmer Blood Elixir (which Brynjolf says will allow one to ""make love like a sabre cat""), as well as a shrine to Dibella, a deity that Svana claims she worships too much. Haelga wears an Amulet of Dibella and there is also a note on her store counter from a ""Secret Lover.""
If the Dragonborn kills her niece, Haelga will flee the bunkhouse. When she comes back, she states she is too upset to talk.
When asked to pay her debts, Haelga will refuse. The Dragonborn can either steal her Dibella Statue and blackmail her to pay or win a fight with her during a brawl. If she is visited last, she will pay the gold demanded without any trouble.

She and Elgrim share the same inventory and gold amount, so there is little difference from bartering with either one unless the Dragonborn prefers Hafjorg's more polite demeanor.
She offers a miscellaneous quest where the Dragonborn is asked to get an ore sample from Filnjar, in Shor's Stone. She will give four random potions as payment when the quest is completed.

Along with Atmah, Hafnar is one of the enthralled wizards that keep Morokei trapped in Labyrinthian. The Dragonborn can discover this by listening to the conversations repeated by the psychic impressions that are triggered as they travel through Labyrinthian during the quest The Staff of Magnus, which detail that Girduin, Elvali Veren and Takes-In-Light all die prior to the remaining mages who confront Morokei.

/wiki/Haldyn,"Haldyn is a Redguard battlemage found in Japhet's Folly Towers on the island called Japhet's Folly. He is the primary antagonist of the quest ""Rise in the East.""
He is the leader of a clan of pirates who call themselves the Blood Horkers, who raid settlements on the northern coast of Skyrim, called the Sea of Ghosts. Their attacks have nearly shut down the East Empire Company Office in Windhelm. He also is the author of Blood Horker Orders.
The East Empire Company has trading offices both in Solitude and in Windhelm, but they are currently having difficulties maintaining their presence in Windhelm because of harassment from a group of pirates called the Blood Horkers. Orthus Endario, the leader of the East Empire Company office in Windhelm, wants to shut them down so he can be back in business and asks the Dragonborn to help.
He is a powerful magician, located at the top of the central tower in Japhet's Folly, who uses Lightning Bolt and Fast Healing. Anti-shock potions and enchanted apparel can be very helpful when attempting to eliminate him. Given that Haldyn relies purely on magic to fight, the Staff of Magnus can be especially useful for draining Haldyn's magicka to the point where he becomes harmless.
An alternative to this is to side-step all of his lightning while keeping a relative distance away from him so that one can safely attack him without him fighting back. It is advised to make sure that he is entirely out of magicka, as he can occasionally pause during his lightning onslaught.
If the Dragonborn wishes to choose a more a stealthy approach (and has a high enough sneak level), they may simply sneak behind Haldyn as he leans over his enchanting table, and stab him in the back. It is recommended that the Dragonborn dual-wields daggers with the 15x damage Assassin's Blade perk (powerful enough daggers should kill him instantly) if they are ill-equipped to defend themselves against the barrage of lightning that Haldyn sends their way once he detects them.
Haldyn wears a full set of Steel Plate Armor (minus the helmet) and also carries horker meat, as is with most Blood Horkers. At lower levels, he may be wearing a set of Steel Armor (also minus the helmet), and if Dragonborn is installed, he wears Nordic Carved Armor on higher levels. In the room where he is found, there are various pieces of minor loot, (soul gems, jewelry, and gold), a scroll or spell tome, and a chest containing some level-dependent armor.",Haldyn,Male Commoner,MaleCommoner,Redguard,Male,,341063,121860

She will gruffly speak to the player once she catches them, stating that they must ""serve penance"" for breaking into the Sanctum, thus starting ""The Heart of Dibella.""
After breaking into the Inner Sanctum (either to steal the Dibella Statue for Degaine, or simply entering at all), Hamal will accost the player, demanding that they pay penance for entering the restricted chamber. Though normally such penance is a term of servitude (for females) or outright death (for males), she will make an exception this time, as the Temple needs a new Sybil, and sends the player to fetch the new Sybil from Broken Tower Redoubt.

Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name. So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines.

Also called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the Morag Tong if only by association with his sibling, Mephala.[3] He usually chooses to appear to mortals as a void of darkness, or as a grotesque mass of tentacles and eyeballs.
He will offer potential servants knowledge that they desire in return for serving him, though many legends, such as those around his Nordic aspect Herma-Mora involve him tricking seekers to gain their knowledge. He is also known to betray his servants to their deaths when he perceives them as having outlived their usefulness to him. 
Hermaeus Mora maintains a realm in Oblivion called Apocrypha, where all forbidden knowledge can be found. It is an endless library, with shelves stretching onward in all directions, stacks on top of stacks. Every book has a black cover with no title. Masses of ghosts move through the stacks, rifling through books, eternally searching for the knowledge they sought whilst living.[5]
This realm can be accessed via Black Books, which can give the reader special abilities. The halls are filled with Seekers who read books and guard the realm. Some areas have Lurkers who also guard the realm and sometimes appear in the mortal realm, unlike the Seekers. It does, however, lack the ghosts mentioned in the above paragraph.[6]
The realm of Apocrypha appears as an endless sea of roiling black oil, with greasy tentacles slithering about the waves beneath a green-tinged sky full of dark clouds and numerous portals through which Hermaeus Mora travels. Rising up from this sea are many cathedral-like structures build of crumbling stone and iron walkways, with books and scrolls crammed haphazardly into countless shelves, or else stacked in massive spiraling towers. The only known residents other than various ghosts are Seekers, Lurkers, and Miraak together with his dragons.[6]
Hermaeus Mora is associated with the ancient tome of knowledge, the Oghma Infinium, apparently given by Mora to Xarxes, the scribe of Auri-El.[7] The knowledge was then, in turn, passed over to Mehrunes Dagon, and was used to write the Mysterium Xarxes.[source?]
The Eternal Champion was able to retrieve the Oghma Infinium from the deep frozen wastes of Skyrim;[8] at that time Hermaeus Mora did not interfere. Then, the Hero of Daggerfall was recorded as the wielder of the tome, sometime in the late Third Era.[9]
Black Books are tomes of esoteric knowledge that are artifacts of Hermaeus Mora, along with the Oghma Infinium. The Black Books are not just regular books; when read, they transport the reader to the realm of Apocrypha. When the books are read inside Apocrypha, they transport the reader back to Solstheim, because Black Books can only be read in Solstheim. The books contain hidden knowledge that, when read, grants the reader great powers and abilities.[10]
The summoning date of Hermaeus Mora is the 5th of First Seed.[UL 1][11] The Hero of Daggerfall quested for the Oghma Infinium by summoning Hermaeus Mora.
The Shrine of Hermaeus Mora is located on a remote plateau deep within the northwestern portion of the Jerall Mountains (possibly due to the fact that he is within the Pantheon of Skyrim, thus being closer to where he is worshipped). After following the path of requirement, the Hero of Kvatch was then able to summon Hermaeus Mora, and was asked to bring one soul of each of the sentient races of Tamriel, so that his followers are able to perform a divination. The Hero was then awarded the Oghma Infinium, furthering their journey on the true path.
Two hundred years after the Oblivion Crisis, the tome would once again become lost. Upon finding an Elder Scroll housed within an Oculory inside the Tower of Mzark, Blackreach, the Dragonborn returned to Septimus Signus, the crazed mage who told the Dragonborn where to find the Elder Scroll during ""Discerning the Transmundane"" and Skyrim's Main Quest.
Septimus had given the Dragonborn a Blank Lexicon which was needed to unlock the Oculory that the Elder Scroll was in. The Blank Lexicon was transformed into a Runed Lexicon, and while doing this, the Lexicon absorbed the infinite amount of unknowable information contained within the Elder Scroll. Upon returning the Lexicon to Septimus, the mage used it to discover the way to open an ancient Dwemer vault. It turns out that Septimus is a follower of Hermaeus Mora, and had been told by the Daedric Prince that the vault contains an artifact of great knowledge and power, the Heart of Lorkhan. In order to open the vault, Septimus must have a sample of blood from all the races of Mer, or Elves. This meant the blood of an Altmer, a Dunmer, a Bosmer, an Orsimer, and a Falmer to recreate the Dwemer blood needed to open the lockbox.
Upon accepting the hunt for these samples of blood, the Dragonborn is contacted by Hermaeus Mora, who appears to them in the form of a Wretched Abyss, or a collection of tentacles with one large eye, if The Elder Scrolls V: Dragonborn is installed. Hermaeus Mora says that Septimus has been a useful tool, but his usefulness will have run out once the vault is open. To that end, Mora commands the Dragonborn to seek out the blood as requested by Septimus, but later after collecting the blood and returning to Septimus, and upon opening the Dwemer vault, Mora disintegrates the mage.
It is revealed that the artifact that was hidden within the Dwemer vault is the Oghma Infinium. After collecting the Oghma Infinium, Mora once again appears as a void in front of the Dragonborn to name them as his new champion. As with previous incarnations of this tome, it functions as a skill tome that greatly boosts the skill levels of all talents relating either to warriors, rogues, or mages.
Sometime before the First Era, the dragon Priest Miraak gave his allegiance to Hermaeus Mora in exchange for being granted the knowledge that would give him great power. With his new found power, Miraak turned against his dragon masters, but was confronted by Vahlok the Jailor, another dragon priest. The battle lasted for days and, despite the outcome being unknown, Hermaeus Mora supposedly intervened, pulling his champion into the realm of Apocrypha to save him. Miraak remained as Mora's champion, albeit using his powers to his own ends and plotting to escape Apocrypha. Sometime during the Fourth Era, the Dragonborn traveled to Apocrypha through the use of a Black Book, an artifact created by Mora to lure mortals into his realm. Mora then spoke to the Dragonborn and offered them the same power that was given to Miraak, as long as they defeated him. He also promised to teach the Dragonborn the second and third words of the Bend Will shout. The second word was given freely. However, the third word was granted in exchange for the Skaal's wisdom and the life of their shaman, Storn Crag-Strider. After learning the second and third Words of Power, the Dragonborn traveled back to Apocrypha and battled with Miraak at the realm's summit. Near defeat, Miraak attempted to escape death by submerging himself into the waters of Apocrypha, but was promptly impaled by Mora's tentacles. Miraak then died of his wounds, and his soul was absorbed by the Dragonborn. Mora then gave Miraak's status as his Champion to the Dragonborn.",Hermaeus Mora,,,Orc,Male,,,130874
/wiki/Hermir_Strong-Heart,"Hermir Strong-Heart is a Nord and a blacksmith-in-training belonging to the Strong-Heart house located in Windhelm.
She is undergoing her training under Oengul War-Anvil, who she considers to be the best blacksmith in all of Skyrim. She is usually found next to the Blacksmith Quarters in Windhelm either on the grindstone or at the workbench.
Hermir will have very few dialogue options, with most of them either praising Oengul or Ulfric. She will give considerable praise to Ulfric Stormcloak, claiming him to be the savior of Skyrim.
She doesn't hide the fact that she enjoys the thought of Stormcloak soldiers using her swords to strike down Imperial soldiers.
If the Dragonborn drops a weapon near her, she will run up to the weapon, pick it up, and hand it back to them saying, ""...you're lucky I found this and not someone else or else it might have been lost for good."" If the dragonborn drops armor near her, she will ask if she can keep it, and if allowed, will pick it up.
If the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion and finally defeats the Stormcloaks in Windhelm, Hermir will start to dislike them, stating that her ""blood boils"" every time she sees them.
The Dragonborn can still interact with her with one new dialogue option about her feelings now that Ulfric is dead. She will state that Ulfric was a true Nord, and stood for a free Skyrim. She also states that she won't hesitate to join in arms with a new leader against the Empire.

/wiki/Hircine,"Hircine as he is depicted in The Elder Scrolls Online.
Hircine (in Daedric script, ) is the main antagonist in The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon and the Daedric Prince whose spirit is the hunt; the sports of Daedra; the greatest game and the chase and sacrifice of mortals. He is known by the titles 'The Huntsman of The Princes', 'The Father of Manbeasts' and 'The Hungry Cat' to Khajiit.[1] The summoning date of Hircine is the 5th of Mid Year. He is also the creator of Lycanthropy.
Hircine, the Spirit of the Hunt's past, leads many to argue. He himself was never mentioned or heard of in the early histories of Nirn. Some scholars believe because of this that Hircine was not one of the original Daedric Princes and is, therefore, a spawn or offshoot, similar to Malacath. However this is often shunned on account of Hircine creating Lycanthropes, and the disease existing well into the Merethic Era. Hircine also appears within the mortal realm once every thousand years; but not to destroy, like some princes, but to enjoy a great hunt known as the Bloodmoon Prophecy.
The Bloodmoon Prophecy is a legend of the Skaal, a native group of Nords from Solstheim. It foretells the Hunt of Hircine, an event which happens every era when the Prince enters Mundus and releases his Hounds upon the land. The Hunt is preceded by four signs. The first is the coming of the ""Hounds,"" when werewolves appear on the island. The second is the ""Fire from the Eye of Glass,"" a pillar of fire which appears on the surface of the frozen Lake Fjalding. The third is the ""Tide of Woe,"" a horker massacre, the bodies of which then wash up all along the island's northern coast. The final sign is the namesake of the prophecy: the ""Bloodmoon,"" when Secunda turns crimson from the blood of the Hunter's Prey.
After the four signs is something called the ""Hunter's Game,"" which varies from era to era. The game might involve the hunting of an entire tribe or just one man. After the hunt, Hircine returns to his realm for another era. The most recent Bloodmoon Prophecy was in 3E 427. It took place within the Mortrag Glacier.
Hircine as he appears during the events of Bloodmoon.
Hircine is one of the more worshipped or, to a certain degree, accepted daedric princes. Although all daedra are completely shunned by mainstream Imperial society, he is often worshipped in greater numbers compared to other daedra, even though he does not necessarily care for it. He is the father of man-beasts and is thusly worshipped by all kinds of lycanthropy-infected creatures such as Werewolves, Wereboars, Werebears, Werelions, and Werecrocodiles. He respects and even praises these creatures if they accomplish something in the hunt, a rare quality for a Daedra. He is often seen as the most honored huntsman to walk any plane of existence, and as such is often looked up to by other hunters, fishers, and trappers.
Reachmen are particularly devoted to Hircine, and the Prince is one of the most prominent spirits in their mythology.[2] Oral traditions of the Reachmen attribute five aspects to Hircine; Alrabeg the Hunter, Storihbeg the Man-Beast, Uricanbeg the Stag, Gulibeg the Fox, and Hrokkibeg the Bear. Some aspects also act as an emissary for Hircine's various functions in Reachmen belief, primarily to the end of culling the ""weak"" from the Prince's herd, for instance Gulibeg is considered a trickster who deceives mortals into foolish deaths, and Uricanbeg, as a stag, functions to actually breed out ""weakness"".[3]
Daedric Princes are almost always looked on as evil due to their destructive nature. While there is some truth in this, this does not apply to all princes. Some princes respect honor and fairness among their subjects and are against dishonorable murder. Hircine is typically considered to be in this category. While he cannot exactly be seen as benevolent, he is very honorable and always gives his prey a sporting chance; he is even willing to be congratulatory to those who were deemed as prey if they manage to turn the hunt to their favor and become the hunters in turn. He is not needlessly destructive like many of his Daedric brethren. With those he does not care for he is often neutral in his trades, unless they are his prey.
Hircine is the patron and creator of the lycanthropic condition. Evidence of this is given when, during the Bloodmoon, Werewolves (also known as Hircine's Hounds) acted as the hunters while the inhabitants of Solstheim were their prey. The individual that can defeat the hounds is honored and would receive favors by the Prince himself, and face Hircine's aspect in one-on-one combat. He is believed by devotees and Hircine himself to be honored to be the prey of the Prince, though very few have survived this battle.
One artifact can suppress the bloodlust suffered under the lycanthropic condition; Hircine's Ring. Sometime before the Warp in the West, this ring was reported resurfaced in the Iliac Bay. The ring makes the Lycanthrope wielder able to turn to beast form or back at will and suppress the hunger. During the Bloodmoon in Solstheim, the enchantment somehow was changed. The ring can allow any person to turn to beast form at will, but for lycanthropes the bloodlust is still there.
On a side note, the witches of the Glenmoril Wyrd Coven of High Rock are known to be worshippers of Hircine, and they will often perform a summoning for anyone that can pay their price. The witches are also able to cure anyone of Lycanthropy, an ability that is alluded to in the book.
The infected person, with the assistance of the witches, must perform a ritual called The Rite of the Wolf Giver. It is an elaborate ritual of dark magicka, requiring the sacrifice of both flesh and innocence. Also, certain ingredients, which are petals of a wolfsbane flower and one bunch of ripened belladonna berries, are needed by the witches to concoct a potion for the rite.
One particularly famous artifact of Hircine, and the one he is most commonly associated with is the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide.[4][5]
This artifact has surfaced multiple times, such as in Battlespire Crisis, where it is required to wield the Spear of Bitter Mercy.[6] Another occasion when it was shown was in Tel Fyr, the house of Divayth Fyr. Divayth, an ancient House Telvanni Wizard and also an artifact collector, was once able to procure the artifact. He then invites Thieves to steal them from the Corprusarium.[7] It then later appears in the Oblivion Crisis, as a reward for completing the Hircine's Shrine Quest.
Another artifact gifted by Hircine is the Ring of Hircine, available in Skyrim. The ring allows the wearer additional werewolf transformations each day. At the end of the quest, the player must select to side with the werewolf or the hunters. If the player sides with the werewolf then they get the Ring of Hircine whereas siding with the hunters gives the player the Savior's Hide. An alternative is to side with the werewolf and to get the ring and then kill and skin him before leaving the grotto.[8]
The Rueful Axe was created by Clavicus Vile so the father of a Hircine worshipper could cure his daughter's curse by killing her.
In 4E 48, Prince Attrebus and Sul needed a fast way to travel to Vivec City. Sul had made a trail which ended in Morrowind to escape from Oblivion when he was trapped in Umbriel. They decided to use an inactive Oblivion Gate from the Oblivion Crisis to access such trail, but they ended up in Hircine's Hunting Grounds. Hircine and his beasts gave chase to the intruders. Sul knew where the door that would take them out of Hircine's realm was, so they mounted the Khajiits from Faashe clan.
Hircine would not show up until after dark, when he would attack with a pack of werewolves. They eventually heard the voice of a horn sound incredibly deep; Hircine was approaching. They were still fifty yards away from the portal, so Lesspa and the remaining Khajiits sacrificed to buy time for Attrebus and Sul. They fought against Hircine, presumably dying.[1]

Some aspects also act as an emissary for Hircine's various functions in Reachmen belief, primarily to the end of culling the ""weak"" from the Prince's herd, for instance Gulibeg is considered a trickster who deceives mortals into foolish deaths, and Uricanbeg, as a stag, functions to actually breed out ""weakness"".[3]
Daedric Princes are almost always looked on as evil due to their destructive nature. While there is some truth in this, this does not apply to all princes. Some princes respect honor and fairness among their subjects and are against dishonorable murder. Hircine is typically considered to be in this category. While he cannot exactly be seen as benevolent, he is very honorable and always gives his prey a sporting chance; he is even willing to be congratulatory to those who were deemed as prey if they manage to turn the hunt to their favor and become the hunters in turn. He is not needlessly destructive like many of his Daedric brethren. With those he does not care for he is often neutral in his trades, unless they are his prey.
Hircine is the patron and creator of the lycanthropic condition. Evidence of this is given when, during the Bloodmoon, Werewolves (also known as Hircine's Hounds) acted as the hunters while the inhabitants of Solstheim were their prey. The individual that can defeat the hounds is honored and would receive favors by the Prince himself, and face Hircine's aspect in one-on-one combat. He is believed by devotees and Hircine himself to be honored to be the prey of the Prince, though very few have survived this battle.
One artifact can suppress the bloodlust suffered under the lycanthropic condition; Hircine's Ring. Sometime before the Warp in the West, this ring was reported resurfaced in the Iliac Bay. The ring makes the Lycanthrope wielder able to turn to beast form or back at will and suppress the hunger. During the Bloodmoon in Solstheim, the enchantment somehow was changed. The ring can allow any person to turn to beast form at will, but for lycanthropes the bloodlust is still there.
On a side note, the witches of the Glenmoril Wyrd Coven of High Rock are known to be worshippers of Hircine, and they will often perform a summoning for anyone that can pay their price. The witches are also able to cure anyone of Lycanthropy, an ability that is alluded to in the book.
The infected person, with the assistance of the witches, must perform a ritual called The Rite of the Wolf Giver. It is an elaborate ritual of dark magicka, requiring the sacrifice of both flesh and innocence. Also, certain ingredients, which are petals of a wolfsbane flower and one bunch of ripened belladonna berries, are needed by the witches to concoct a potion for the rite.
One particularly famous artifact of Hircine, and the one he is most commonly associated with is the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide.[4][5]
This artifact has surfaced multiple times, such as in Battlespire Crisis, where it is required to wield the Spear of Bitter Mercy.[6] Another occasion when it was shown was in Tel Fyr, the house of Divayth Fyr. Divayth, an ancient House Telvanni Wizard and also an artifact collector, was once able to procure the artifact. He then invites Thieves to steal them from the Corprusarium.[7] It then later appears in the Oblivion Crisis, as a reward for completing the Hircine's Shrine Quest.
Another artifact gifted by Hircine is the Ring of Hircine, available in Skyrim. The ring allows the wearer additional werewolf transformations each day. At the end of the quest, the player must select to side with the werewolf or the hunters. If the player sides with the werewolf then they get the Ring of Hircine whereas siding with the hunters gives the player the Savior's Hide. An alternative is to side with the werewolf and to get the ring and then kill and skin him before leaving the grotto.[8]

/wiki/Hircine,"Hircine as he is depicted in The Elder Scrolls Online.
Hircine (in Daedric script, ) is the main antagonist in The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon and the Daedric Prince whose spirit is the hunt; the sports of Daedra; the greatest game and the chase and sacrifice of mortals. He is known by the titles 'The Huntsman of The Princes', 'The Father of Manbeasts' and 'The Hungry Cat' to Khajiit.[1] The summoning date of Hircine is the 5th of Mid Year. He is also the creator of Lycanthropy.
Hircine, the Spirit of the Hunt's past, leads many to argue. He himself was never mentioned or heard of in the early histories of Nirn. Some scholars believe because of this that Hircine was not one of the original Daedric Princes and is, therefore, a spawn or offshoot, similar to Malacath. However this is often shunned on account of Hircine creating Lycanthropes, and the disease existing well into the Merethic Era. Hircine also appears within the mortal realm once every thousand years; but not to destroy, like some princes, but to enjoy a great hunt known as the Bloodmoon Prophecy.
The Bloodmoon Prophecy is a legend of the Skaal, a native group of Nords from Solstheim. It foretells the Hunt of Hircine, an event which happens every era when the Prince enters Mundus and releases his Hounds upon the land. The Hunt is preceded by four signs. The first is the coming of the ""Hounds,"" when werewolves appear on the island. The second is the ""Fire from the Eye of Glass,"" a pillar of fire which appears on the surface of the frozen Lake Fjalding. The third is the ""Tide of Woe,"" a horker massacre, the bodies of which then wash up all along the island's northern coast. The final sign is the namesake of the prophecy: the ""Bloodmoon,"" when Secunda turns crimson from the blood of the Hunter's Prey.
After the four signs is something called the ""Hunter's Game,"" which varies from era to era. The game might involve the hunting of an entire tribe or just one man. After the hunt, Hircine returns to his realm for another era. The most recent Bloodmoon Prophecy was in 3E 427. It took place within the Mortrag Glacier.
Hircine as he appears during the events of Bloodmoon.
Hircine is one of the more worshipped or, to a certain degree, accepted daedric princes. Although all daedra are completely shunned by mainstream Imperial society, he is often worshipped in greater numbers compared to other daedra, even though he does not necessarily care for it. He is the father of man-beasts and is thusly worshipped by all kinds of lycanthropy-infected creatures such as Werewolves, Wereboars, Werebears, Werelions, and Werecrocodiles. He respects and even praises these creatures if they accomplish something in the hunt, a rare quality for a Daedra. He is often seen as the most honored huntsman to walk any plane of existence, and as such is often looked up to by other hunters, fishers, and trappers.
Reachmen are particularly devoted to Hircine, and the Prince is one of the most prominent spirits in their mythology.[2] Oral traditions of the Reachmen attribute five aspects to Hircine; Alrabeg the Hunter, Storihbeg the Man-Beast, Uricanbeg the Stag, Gulibeg the Fox, and Hrokkibeg the Bear.

Hogni has gruff and impatient mannerisms which annoy many of the citizens of Markarth when he is working. He hates being cheated out of money, which has caused him issue with Degaine's begging and when people turn down his food. Similarly, he dislikes both sides of the Skyrim Civil War, as both the Stormcloaks and Imperials expect compensation. He additionally has a strange fixation on blood and meat, which tends to be a source of discomfort for those around him. Hogni is actually a cannibal, which perhaps explain why he is obsessed with blood. When not at his stall in the market, he tends to keep to himself, taking the largest room in the Silver-Blood Inn so he has more space. 
Like most Nords in the Reach, he detests the Forsworn, believing that they are nothing but trouble.
If asked about the source of his meat, he reveals the location of Dushnikh Yal, an Orc Stronghold where he gets his supplies.
When first arriving in Markarth, Weylin is seen speaking to Hogni before then drawing his dagger to make his move on Margret.

Like Kerah, he will refuse to sell anything due to the event.

/wiki/Idgrod_Ravencrone,"Idgrod Ravencrone is an Elder Nord Jarl of Hjaalmarch, headquartered in Morthal. She sides with the Empire in the Civil War of Skyrim. She purports to be a seer of psychic visions and dreams.
Idgrod appears relaxed, and chooses to quote phrases of wisdom and patience. She is quite wise and learned, but most of her people seem to think she is losing the plot due to her enigmatic personality and affiliation with magic. Though she aligns her Hold with the Empire, she is not particularly concerned with the war (a trait she shares with Jarl Balgruuf the Greater of Whiterun) and also dislikes the Thalmor due to their ruthless and treacherous nature.
She associates herself with Falion, a newcomer to Hjaalmarch and a wizard. Because of their kinship, she is mistrusted by the members of Morthal. However, although he is disliked by the rest of the town, she claims he is more altruistic than bothersome.
Several individuals within Morthal despise her because she accepts Falion into her court, and because she seems not to bother with most ""petty"" problems in the hold. Idgrod has a daughter, Idgrod the Younger, and a son, Joric, whom she raises with her husband, and steward, Aslfur. Gorm is her Housecarl.
If the Dragonborn has assisted her, or became Thane of Hjaalmarch, she recognizes who the Dragonborn is and, if prompted, provides the necessary distraction for the Dragonborn to slip away from Elenwen's party and continue the quest into the kitchen. Her attendance at the party, whilst the other Jarls did not attend unless certain conditions had been met, is unjustified. Idgrod walks over to Razelan and begin making a scene, using him as the unwitting victim. Her justification for causing the scene is that ""an old woman can get away with anything."" She may chat with Maven Black-Briar if she is in attendance.
If the Dragonborn decides to side with the Stormcloaks, Idgrod is replaced by Sorli the Builder as Jarl of Morthal. Idgrod can then be found in the Blue Palace in Solitude, along with the other replaced Jarls, Stewards, and Housecarls.
Speaking with a citizen about the burned down home in Morthal prompts the Dragonborn to seek out Idgrod. She needs the event to be investigated, since a young girl, Helgi, died in the blaze. Investigating the site at night, the Dragonborn learns that the girl's ghost haunts the place. Idgrod claims Morthal is alive with spiritual energy and says to check the graveyard.
After reporting Falion to the jarl, she will immediately find and confront him, threatening dire consequences for Falion if he continues his actions.

/wiki/Irileth,"Irileth is a Dunmer nightblade and a resident of Whiterun in Skyrim who lives in Dragonsreach. She acts as housecarl to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater, and rarely leaves his side. She assists the Dragonborn in their first battle against the dragon, Mirmulnir. She is encountered again later, as ally or enemy, during the Civil War questline.
Irileth is one of four housecarls in the game who is not a Nord. The others are Faleen, the Redguard housecarl of Jarl Igmund of Markarth, Rayya, also a Redguard, who is the housecarl of the Thane of Falkreath Hold, and the fourth is Teeba-Ei who becomes the housecarl to Sorli the Builder if she becomes Jarl of Hjaalmarch during the Civil War.
Being early battle comrades, Irileth and Balgruuf agreed that she would be assigned as his Housecarl. It is known that Irileth is more protective of the Jarl than most Housecarls. At some point in her life, Irileth was trained by the Morag Tong guild of Morrowind.
Irileth is very serious about her job and her loyalty to Balgruuf, occasionally to the point of paranoia. Even after the Dragonborn kills Mirmulnir, Irileth remains distrustful of him/her, though she still tells the Dragonborn that she is glad that they are on her side. She does not seem to care much about Skyrim's traditions or tales; after Mirmulnir is slain, she refuses to involve herself in debating about the Dragonborn's identity; she is simply relieved that the dragon is dead.
If the Dragonborn visits Irileth in the Blue Palace after claiming Whiterun for the Stormcloaks, she speaks of the many dark ways she has dreamt of the Dragonborn's death. Additionally, she is very suspicious of the Dragonborn, approaching them with her weapon drawn and saying that she has constantly got her eye on them.
When Mirmulnir attacks the Western Watchtower, Irileth is quick to arrive and inform Farengar and Balgruuf of such. The group then converses with a guard who witnessed the dragon arriving. Balgruuf decides to send Irileth to the watchtower to deal with the issue, and opts to send the Dragonborn as well. Irileth shortly gathers some men by the main gate, where she convinces them that the honor to kill the dragon is Whiterun's. 
The party heads west, where she orders the group to search for survivors while the dragon is out of sight. After conversing with the only survivor at the watchtower, Mirmulnir returns, and so Irileth leads the battle against him. Once the dragon is downed, she witnesses the Dragonborn absorb his soul; however, unlike the guards, she does not praise the Dragonborn for being Dovahkiin, but rather for simply killing the dragon. She then assumes command of the watchtower for the time being and orders the Dragonborn to report back to Balgruuf.
If the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion, then the Dragonborn will fight alongside Irileth to protect Whiterun from the Stormcloaks. Alternatively, siding with the Stormcloaks means the Dragonborn must fight Irileth, along with Balgruuf and several of the Whiterun Guards.

/wiki/J%27zargo_(Skyrim),"J'zargo is a Khajiit apprentice at the College of Winterhold in Skyrim. He is a potential follower and is eligible to become a member of the Blades. When not accompanying the Dragonborn, he can be found at the College of Winterhold either in the Hall of Attainment or the Hall of the Elements.
A skilled mage, J'zargo is confident to the point of arrogance, offering few words of praise for the work of others. He is highly competitive and strives to be the best of the College's students, using any means available, including theft and reckless experimentation. Despite his great ambition, he has no qualms accepting that he still has a long way to go before becoming a powerful wizard.
Along with Onmund and Brelyna Maryon, he criticizes Tolfdir for not teaching them enough magic during their first meeting, though depending on how the Dragonborn responds when Tolfdir asks them for their opinion, J'zargo or one of the others will respond accordingly.
He accompanies the Dragonborn in the Saarthal excavation along with Onmund, Tolfdir and Brelyna Maryon. He is tasked with checking to make sure they are the first arrivals and that no tombs have been tampered with.
Agreeing to help J'zargo experiment with a batch of scrolls, the Dragonborn uses them on undead as instructed. Serving as a Flame Cloak spell, the scrolls deal extra damage to undead creatures, but upon coming into contact with undead also cause an explosion that damages the Dragonborn and any followers, which can cause the follower to turn on the Dragonborn. Reporting to J'zargo the results of the experiment opens him up as a follower. Afterward, he will ask the Dragonborn to test later iterations of the scrolls, eventually resulting in a working version.
He is equipped with non removable novice robes and a novice hood and a hunting bow. However, if he is hired as a follower and provided with other armor, should he equip the new armor, it is possible to pickpocket the default one after dismissing him.
J'zargo equips one-handed weapons, heavy armor, and light armor if they are given to him, but in combat, he tends to use dual cast destruction spells until his magicka runs out. He favors shock spells. Despite being a mage, he has an unusually high skill in heavy armor as well as one-handed weaponry. Giving him the Nahkriin or Zahkriisos mask may be helpful. (Zahkriisos can only be obtained if the Dragonborn add-on is installed.) The former in general allows him to cast more spells, while the latter can significantly increase his damage output at higher levels.
While in combat with higher level foes, he appears to use more powerful versions of the normal spells that he uses, or a spell crafted for him; that gives an appearance as a normal destruction class spell. For example, when fighting dragons on adept difficulty or lower, he will do a significant amount of damage, often killing the dragon before the Dragonborn has the chance to inflict notable damage.
While in prolonged combat, he may run out of magicka and will use his fists regardless of any weapon or shield the Dragonborn gave him. While he does equip such items, dual-cast Sparks is equipped as soon as a combat is started. When he regenerates magicka after fist fighting for a few seconds, he will start casting fireball spells. At a long distance in the open, he will use Ice Spikes as his preferred spell.
While in combat with melee opponents, he will hold out for himself very well, backing up as he is casting rather than standing still; placing him in top tier heavy armor only improves his combat usefulness. However, he will not survive for long while fighting other mage class foes that cast magic.
J'zargo will always use a unique dagger like the Blade of Woe or Mehrunes Razor if it is given to him. He will also always use any bow with a lightning enchantment instead of his default hunting bow.
J'zargo's health is high and regenerates fast, giving the Dragonborn no need to heal him during combat. This is a reason for J'zargo's state as one of the most durable followers. It should be noted that unlike most other followers, he levels with the Dragonborn all the way to level 81 until patch 1.9, and he has no level cap after the patch. His only weakness is that he favors low level shock spells, hindering his damage performance.
A ward being used to block Frostbite cast by J'zargo in the Hall of the Elements.
J'zargo knows a total of thirteen spells, but will only cast nine as a follower, and the others as a regular character in combat.

He approaches the Dragonborn, claiming that he has a plan to rob an Imperial ship which will soon dock in Solitude. He asks the them to go to the Solitude Lighthouse and put out the fire there so that the ship will wreck on the nearby coast.
After extinguishing the fire at Solitude Lighthouse, Jaree-Ra instructs the Dragonborn to go to the Wreck of the Icerunner to claim their reward. Once there, his sister, Deeja, thanks them for helping out, and then suddenly attempts to kill them. Upon killing Deeja, the Dragonborn can loot her for a note from Jaree-Ra.

/wiki/Jenassa,"Jenassa is a Dunmer mercenary and a potential follower. She can be found in The Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun.
Jenassa has a lust for killing and advertises her shadowy sensibilities to the Dragonborn upon first meeting. She charges the standard 500  fee to recruit. When dismissed, she lingers in The Drunken Huntsman or, if married, the home chosen for her.
She has a dark, murderous nature and has no qualms with any similar tendencies present in her employer; she abstains from interfering in any crimes the Dragonborn may commit, and can even be ordered to attack almost anyone, including hold guards. However, it should be noted that she will not stop attacking an enemy, even if the Dragonborn and the hostile character have sheathed their weapons. This can earn the Dragonborn a large bounty.
She can be recruited into the Blades during the quest ""Rebuilding the Blades"" and is also a potential marriage candidate but cannot become a steward. Both waive any subsequent recruitment fees; she must, however, be hired once before marriage or Blades recruitment becomes an option.
Jenassa is skilled in Archery, Light Armor, One-Handed, Block, and Sneak. She can use Bows, Shields with One-Handed weapons and Light Armor quite effectively.
She possesses no magical abilities. She can wear both heavy armor and light armor but prefers the latter. She equips heavy armor only if no stronger light armor appears in her inventory. She also seems to prefer equipping a heavy armor helmet rather than a light armor helmet.
She equips the weapon with the highest base damage for melee, although when working with two weapons with the same base damage, she seems to take into account the power of any enchantments placed on them.
Jenassa will naturally dual wield any two weapons given to her, without the need to first equip her with a pickaxe, as is the case with most other followers. She is one of few followers who dual wields weapons as a first choice in combat, along with Frea DR, Ria, and Rayya.
Like other followers that use bows, she will pick up stray arrows and use them. She can equip most types of arrows, although she only requires one of them to have an endless supply. She will also use a staff, and can dual wield with them.
Jenassa is a possible marriage candidate. When married, Jenassa opens a shop and will give the Dragonborn a profit of 100  a day, which adds up every day if it is not collected. She can be both a follower and a spouse simultaneously.

Joric appears to have inherited the same gift of psychic foresight that his mother also claims to have. His erratic behavior seems to be closely connected to these psychic visions he sometimes receives.

He is proud to serve Ulfric, but if the Dragonborn sided with the Imperials in the Civil War, he mentions that he will never miss Ulfric's fiery temper. Once Fort Neugrad has been captured for the Stormcloaks in the Civil War, the Dragonborn can buy the house, Hjerim, for 12,000 , although he will accept 8,000  or more, and also hands out the Windhelm Home Decorating Guide upon purchase.
He is essential in the quest ""Blood on the Ice,"" as the guards will only let the Dragonborn investigate if Jorleif permits it. According to the Skyrim Strategy Guide, Jorleif is supposed to be replaced by Captain Lonely-Gale as steward if Windhelm has fallen to Imperial control, but sometimes Jorleif still remains the steward.
Although the guards want the Dragonborn's help, they can go to Jorleif and receive official permission to do so. Throughout the quest, he can be returned to in order to obtain clues on what to do next. Eventually, Wuunferth the Unliving will become the prime suspect of the murders. The Dragonborn can report this to Jorleif, who will then order a guard to follow him and promptly arrest Wuunferth. Once the real killer has been killed, the Dragonborn returns to Jorleif a final time to end the quest. If Wuunferth was wronfully imprisoned as a result, he will then be released.
Talking to Jorlief can start miscellaneous Bounty Quests in the Hold of Eastmarch. Alternatively, innkeepers will begin these quests, although Jorleif must be reported to in order to claim the reward regardless. This can be done infinitely as long as he is steward.
How do I get into Hjerim? ""Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed. I think her mother, Tova, has the key.""

/wiki/Jurgen_Windcaller,"Jurgen Windcaller, later known as Jurgen the Calm,[1] was a Nord chieftain and hero from the First Era who was believed to be the mightiest of all the Tongues. He was the founder of The Greybeards.
During the War of Succession, in the middle of the Battle of Red Mountain, Jurgen Windcaller helped his fellow Nords in a war against the Dwemer and the Chimer. During the battle, the Dwemer and the Chimer completely annihilated the Nordic armies, forcing them out of Morrowind and back to Skyrim.
After the aforementioned disastrous battle, where his army was annihilated, he spent seven years pondering the meaning of his defeat.[2][3] He finally came to the conclusion that the Gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Thu'um. Following this revelation, Jurgen developed a pacifist creed called the Way of the Voice that preached the Thu'um should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods rather than martial exploits.[1][4] After he converted to pacifism he became known as ""Jurgen the Calm.""[1]
His philosophy prevailed, largely due to his unshakable mastery of the Voice. His victory was sealed in a legendary confrontation, where The Calm is said to have ""swallowed the Shouts"" of seventeen Tongues of the militant school for three days until his opponents all lay exhausted. These Tongues later became his disciples.[1][2]
It was after this confrontation he founded the Greybeards, a monastic order dedicated to mastering the Way of the Voice. He also built High Hrothgar,[2] located near the peak of Throat of the World, which served as the monastery where the Greybeards meditated and perfected their voice.[4]
It is unknown when or how Jurgen Windcaller died, but he was buried in Ustengrav along with some of his possessions, including his horn. His sarcophagus reads ""Windcaller"" in Daedric, it is unknown why this is the case.
During the quest ""The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller,"" the Dragonborn is required to retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller from Ustengrav.

He is one of the primary antagonists of the quest ""Forbidden Legend"" and a minor antagonist of the College of Winterhold questline.
Jyrik was the eldest son of Lord Gauldur, the Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold. He and his brothers, Mikrul and Sigdis, coveted their father's amulet, which held immense power. Recovering the artifact, he and his brothers stormed the cities of Skyrim with summoned armies, ending many lives in their mad conquest. Sent by Arch-Mage Geirmund, a battalion of battlemages was dispatched to end the spree, sealing the brothers away in their respective tombs with Writs of Sealing. Jyrik himself was pursued to the already ancient ruin of Saarthal and trapped within. A powerful elemental mage, Jyrik slew ten veteran wizards before he was finally bested.[1]
When his chamber is first entered, Jyrik is invincible. A few seconds later, Tolfdir tells the Dragonborn to keep him busy, and rushes downstairs. He runs past Jyrik and begins shooting bolts of lightning at the orb, draining it of some of its power, which lowers Jyrik's defenses and leaves him vulnerable. His body will glow in the corresponding elements (Fire, Lightning, and Frost), meaning he has increased resistance against them.

/wiki/Karliah,"Karliah is a Dunmer thief, a member of the Nightingales and a former member of the Thieves Guild. She is involved in five of the Thieves Guild quests, during which she becomes a temporary follower.
Karliah was trained in the art of thievery by her mother, Dralsi Indoril, and is the granddaughter of Queen Barenziah, as well as Drayven Indoril, who is rumored to be a descendant of the Dunmer saint Indoril Nerevar. She was a member of the Thieves Guild and the Nightingales along with Gallus Desidenius and Mercer Frey.[1] She was also involved romantically with Gallus Desidenius, who called her his ""Little Nightingale."" She also stated that she owes her skills to Gallus saying ""He honed my skill to a razor sharp point."" Karliah was exiled from the guild for 25 years after Mercer framed her for Gallus' murder. Since then, she prepared to take vengeance on him for Gallus' murder and framing her for it, along with betraying Nocturnal and the Thieves Guild with using his lies to become Guildmaster.
Karliah is the only Dunmer in the game whose eyes are violet. Her armor is a lighter shade of gray than the Guild Master's Armor Set and has the same brown-colored straps and satchels of the Thieves Guild Armor. Parts of it can appear purplish in some light, and it also appears to have a unique dagger strapped to the left shoulder, though it is for aesthetic purposes.
Mercer Frey and the Dragonborn hunt for Karliah in the dungeon Snow Veil Sanctum, after she hinted that is where she wanted to face Mercer due to being the place where Gallus was murdered.
Once Mercer picks the dragon claw door, the Dragonborn walks in first. Karliah shoots the Dragonborn with a poisoned arrow, and the Dragonborn passes out soon after. Awakening again, their vision is blurry, and Mercer and Karliah are heard talking. From their dialogue, it is learned that Mercer is guilty of committing many crimes against the guild. Karliah escapes thanks to using an invisibility potion since she knew facing Mercer now was a death sentence and Mercer notices the Dragonborn is still alive.
He stabs the Dragonborn, attempting to kill them to ensure the truth is never exposed, but because of the poison on Karliah's arrow, made to slow the victim's heartbeat and stop them from bleeding out, they survive. Karliah then takes them back to her camp outside the Sanctum to nurse them back to health. After the Dragonborn regains their strength, Karliah sends them to Winterhold to figure out how to decode Gallus's Encoded Journal.
The Dragonborn is sent to Calcelmo by Enthir to duplicate the writings on Calcelmo's stone, in Calcelmo's Tower. He will not let them in, so the Dragonborn has to gain entry to the museum in another way. Once the translation is acquired, Karliah will be present at the Frozen Hearth inn with Enthir who will translate the passages, confirming that Mercer not only stole vast amounts of gold from the Guild, but desecrated something called the ""Twilight Sepulcher."" Karliah will express utter shock at this but cannot elaborate just yet. With the evidence in hand, Karliah asks the Dragonborn to meet her in The Ragged Flagon to confront Mercer and reveal the truth to the guild, awarding them with an item which once belonged to Gallus: a level-dependent Nightingale Blade.
The Dragonborn meets Karliah and faces the guild with her, who are still in the belief she was Gallus' murderer due to Mercer's lies. Karliah hands over Gallus' journal as proof of her innocence and joins Brynjolf and the others as the vault is opened to reveal that Mercer robbed it dry. Though this vindicates her, she is just as angry as the rest of them and refers the Dragonborn to Brynjolf, who asks them to find evidence of Mercer Frey's whereabouts and will have to infiltrate his house to get his plans.
The Dragonborn learns about the Nightingales and is taken to the Nightingale Hall by Karliah and Brynjolf to become a Nightingale. She wants them to be prepared for the task of killing Mercer Frey for his betrayal. Once there, after all three suit up in their Nightingale Armor, Karliah summons Nocturnal, patron Daedric Prince of thieves, and asks to reinstate her Nightingale status along with granting it to the Dragonborn and Brynjolf. Nocturnal grants her blessing, making them all Nightingales, and they set off to take vengeance on Mercer.
Karliah and Brynjolf have traveled to Irkngthand in their pursuit of Mercer Frey. They want the Dragonborn to meet them there. Inside they need to locate and eliminate Mercer and take the Skeleton Key he has stolen from Nocturnal. When they find him attempting to secure the Eyes of the Falmer before making good his escape from Skyrim, he separates the Dragonborn from Karliah and Brynjolf, before using a Frenzy-type spell on Brynjolf, forcing him into fighting Karliah against his will. The spell is broken once the Dragonborn slays Mercer, and all three escape the flooding chamber when a hole opens in the ceiling, leading them safely out to Bronze Water Cave.
The Dragonborn must return the Skeleton Key, and in order to do so, they have to follow the Pilgrim's Path inside the Twilight Sepulcher. After this is done, The Dragonborn can go back to the cave and choose a power each day. Karliah is also allowed a chance to make peace with the spirit of Gallus before he departs to return to Nocturnal's realm.
How could Mercer have gotten into the Vault? ""All I can tell you for now is that he's abused his authority as a Nightingale.""
I don't feel stronger. ""With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from Nocturnal's gifts.""",Karliah,Karliah,FemaleUniqueKarliah,Dark Elf,Female,,364314,110719

If the Companions questline is completed, the Dragonborn becomes Harbinger and cleanses Kodlak of his Lycanthropy. He can later be seen in Sovngarde among the other lost spirits that are trapped in the mist formed by Alduin.
Kodlak was found by the previous Harbinger, Askar, in Hammerfell.[1] Sometime after this, Kodlak succeeded Askar as Harbinger. Kodlak has commanded the Companions for twenty years, balancing his tactical skill, ferocity in combat, and commanding presence. However, those days are drawing to a close. One year before the return of the dragons, Kodlak contracted the rot, despite werewolves having a 100% disease immunity. His condition has reached its final stages of deterioration, making him weak in body. In frustration, he has taken to locking himself behind closed doors and poring over old documents, desperate to cure himself of lycanthropy before the rot ends his life.[2]
Just before the arrival of the Dragonborn, a dream came to Kodlak. As he describes in his journal, he dreamed of Tsun denying the former Harbingers access to Shor's Hall, where honored heroes gather. One by one, their wolf spirit drags them to Hircine, to hunt with him forever. Kodlak helplessly watches as his turn comes and his beast attacks him. However, a stranger arrives to protect him. This person drives back the beast and saves his soul. After seeing the Dragonborn for the first time, Kodlak recognizes them as that person and thus allows the Dragonborn to become a Companion.
Kodlak Whitemane proves to be a benign and wise individual for such a rowdy group. As Harbinger, he is the one that helps channel the Companions' skills in a way that can benefit Skyrim's people, rather than leaving them to brawl and drink all day long. His wisdom is respected throughout the nine holds, as well. When the Dragonborn first meets Kodlak, he is in his twilight years. He has lost his will to win glory in battle, partially because his body cannot allow it. He hints annoyance at this limitation, but he never openly complains.
Kodlak proves to be very wise and perceptive. He could see the Dragonborn's potential instantly, aside from the fact he had seen them in a dream. His awareness is also apparent when he discovers the secret campaign to avenge Skjor. He informs the Dragonborn that the circle of retribution will turn on them and that they have taken more blood than honor demands. Kodlak's foresight is proven correct by the Silver Hand's attack on Jorrvaskr. His observation on honor is very definitive as well; while he grieves at Skjor's loss, he does not condone unnecessary bloodshed, as it is dishonorable. He explains how wrong it can be to react in fury and grief, and he follows this statement. Even with his stern disapproval, Kodlak is not angry with the Dragonborn's actions and gives the Dragonborn a chance for redemption.
Stoic in disposition, Kodlak can be very withdrawn at times. During the storyline, the Dragonborn learns that he is haunted by the thought of joining Hircine in the afterlife. As a true Nord, he wishes to go to Sovngarde, and he persistently devotes his time to trying to find a cure.
As the Dragonborn enters Jorrvaskr, they can ask one of the Companions on how to join. Every one of them will say that they need to speak with Kodlak, the Harbinger. Should the Dragonborn decide to find him, he will first be seen talking with Vilkas about his lycanthropy at the end of the living quarters downstairs. If the Dragonborn asks him about joining the Companions, he will immediately accept them, deeming them worthy. Vilkas, however, disagrees and is surprised at Kodlak's decision. Kodlak will then tell Vilkas to spar with the Dragonborn out in the courtyard to test their strength.
In this quest, Kodlak tells the Dragonborn to kill the Glenmoril Witches and take one of their heads, so that Kodlak can cure himself of lycanthropy and get into Sovngarde. While returning to Jorrvaskr after slaying the Glenmoril Witches, the Dragonborn finds out that the Silver Hand attacked the mead hall. Upon entering Jorrvaskr, Kodlak is found dead, and the pieces of Wuuthrad stolen. Vilkas then claims his death will be avenged, and he and the Dragonborn set out to recover the stolen pieces of Wuuthrad.
The Dragonborn must attend Kodlak's funeral at the Skyforge, joined by many residents of Whiterun. Afterwards, the Circle's members gather in The Underforge, to discuss on curing Kodlak's spirit of lycanthropy. They set out to Ysgramor's Tomb, where the ritual can be performed. After throwing a Glenmoril Witch Head at the fire in the depths of the tomb, Kodlak's wolf spirit appears. Defeating it will cure Kodlak's lycanthropy, granting him access to the Nordic afterlife, Sovngarde. Kodlak's spirit then briefly reappears to grant the Dragonborn the title of Harbinger of the Companions succeeding Kodlak as the new leader of the Companions.",Kodlak Whitemane,Kodlak Whitemane,MaleUniqueKodlakWhitemane,Nord,Male,,108175,108174

He does not approve of the College of Winterhold, and his opinions are typically ignored by the other Jarls, due to Winterhold not being seen as one of the ""important"" holds in Skyrim. If banished from Winterhold, he will reside in Brunwulf Free-Winter's house in Windhelm with his family.
Korir's influence is deeply affected by The Great Collapse and the existence of the College of Winterhold. He carries the grudges of his ancestors while refusing to abandon his home, but fails to realize the impact this has on his son. Despite this, he continues to serve Winterhold dutifully as its staunch protector in troubled times.
If the Dragonborn asks him for work, he sends them to recover the Helm of Winterhold, hoping to improve the standing of Winterhold.
In order to be named Thane of Winterhold, the Dragonborn must help three residents of Winterhold.

If he becomes Jarl after the Dragonborn trades Winterhold for The Reach in Season Unending, and the Dragonborn later retakes the hold for Jarl Korir, he will be exiled to Erikur's House in Solitude.
By all accounts, Kraldar may be one of the last in a long line of nobility in Winterhold, due to the cataclysmic Great Collapse in 4E 122. He understands that the College of Winterhold needs to be placated, and being on good terms with the Arch-Mage is in Winterhold's best interest, unlike his predecessor. Ever the optimist, he firmly believes that Winterhold will be returned to greatness one day, and often regales his housecarl, Thonjolf, with his dreams for the future.

He is often bored with his rank—he will frequently ask Thonjolf for the latest rumors in Winterhold.

/wiki/Laelette_the_Vampire,"Laelette the Vampire Laelette is a Breton vampire residing in Morthal. She is the wife of Thonnir, and mother of Virkmund, and a servant of Alva.
Alva, a vampire, fed from Laelette when she came to visit her. Alva decided to keep her alive to use as a personal servant. Suspicious of Laelette's disappearance, Thonnir, her husband, went to Alva for an explanation, since Laelette was last seen visiting Alva. Alva told Thonnir she left Morthal to join the Stormcloaks.
When Alva charmed Hroggar and wanted to enthrall him and keep him as a guardian of her coffin, she ordered Laelette to murder his family and make it look like an accident. Instead, Laelette burned their home to the ground, with the family still inside. During the burning, she became enamored with Helgi, Hroggar's daughter, and gave her vampiric blood, although she did not survive the fire.
Laelette became obsessed with Helgi, visiting her coffin nightly at the Morthal Cemetery to try to raise her back from the dead.
After speaking to Helgi's ghost, the Dragonborn returns to the Jarl of Morthal (who is either Idgrod Ravencrone or Sorli the Builder, depending on the status of the Civil War).

/wiki/Laila_Law-Giver,"Laila Law-Giver is a Nord in Skyrim who, as Jarl of Riften, resides with her court in Mistveil Keep, where she holds court.
Laila has two children, Harrald, the older and Saerlund, the younger. Both differ in their opinions on who they should side with in the Civil War.
Because she supports the Stormcloaks, the Jarl believes that Saerlund has lost his mind or is possessed, so she tells her Court Wizard, Wylandriah, to find a reason. She believes she has the Thieves Guild problem under control, and her advisors reinforce her belief. Her housecarl is Unmid Snow-Shod and her steward is Anuriel.
Even though Laila supports the Stormcloaks, she agrees that Ulfric may just want to be crowned High King after having killed the previous one, Torygg, to remove a potential pawn for the Empire with keeping control of Skyrim over having it become independent.
She gives the Dragonborn pointers of where to look for the criminals. She later rewards the Dragonborn with the title of Thane if they are known throughout the hold and have purchased Honeyside in Riften.
A conversation with Wujeeta makes the player aware that she is part of Riften's skooma ring and offers an option to tell Jarl Laila Law-Giver, should she still be in power. If this option is completed, the Jarl reveals that she is already well aware of the skooma dealers in the Riften Warehouse, and offers the task of suppressing the skooma operation. They have been long trying to track down the elusive skooma traders.
Once the Dragonborn presents evidence of where the skooma operation is originating from in Cragslane Cavern, Laila gives the Dragonborn the go-ahead to eliminate everyone inside and shut down the operation. Doing so will be enough to convince Laila to consider naming the Dragonborn a Thane of Riften and the Rift.
As a supporter of Ulfric Stormcloak and his rebellion, if she is removed from her position, she is exiled along with the rest of her family from Riften. She is then replaced by Maven Black-Briar, an affluent Nord noble who controls most aspects of the city even before her reign as Jarl. Laila can then be found at the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm. There, she laments on how she failed the people of Riften. Her Hold Guards will also be replaced by Imperial Legionnaires as the new Hold Guards of Riften and other communities in the Rift.
Sarthis Idren has been taken care of. ""It's nice to receive good news for a change. Did you recover anything else from the warehouse worth mentioning?""

When she has little else to do, Lami claims to often mix various ingredients together in hopes of discovering new potions, but usually goes through most of her stock in the process while having little success.
Lami and Alva share a bond together. This becomes apparent when Alva is killed in plain sight, after which Lami will become unfriendly to the Dragonborn from that moment on. The bond can be further revealed by requesting the relationship rank between Lami and Alva from the command console.
It is also possible that Alva has begun influencing Lami, much like she has previously done with Hroggar and Laelette, as Alva has plans to influence the citizens of Morthal one at a time.

Fasendil is in charge of the Imperial soldiers at the Rift Imperial Camp. He is an essential character, which means he cannot be killed. If the Rift is taken by the Empire during the Civil War, he will instead be found in Mistveil Keep, located in Riften.
Fasendil hails from Cyrodiil. He is the son of two travelling Altmer merchants who settled there. He grew up in the province and, once he came of age, joined the Imperial Legion to see more of the world. However, he claims he has seen much more than he bargained for.
If the Dragonborn is not a Nord, a dialogue option is available regarding an observation that the local Nords do not like outsiders in their lands. Despite this, Fasendil feels Skyrim and its people are still a part of the Empire, and, as such, are entitled to the Legion's protection.
Even though he is an Altmer, Fasendil has an outward disdain for the Thalmor. The origin of such stems from his station in Hammerfell's city Sentinel in 4E 42, during the Night of Green Fire. Thalmor Mages were sent there to capture Altmer dissidents who have escaped execution from the Summerset Isles.
When he was on his way, a huge explosion of magicka erupted from the refugee sector of the city as the Thalmor Mages and the Altmer dissidents fought each other. When Fasendil arrived at the scene, the entire refugee sector had been destroyed as a result of the battle. 
After an unspecified amount of time after this incident, Fasendil was stationed in Skyrim by order of Emperor Titus Mede II to keep an eye on the Thalmor.

/wiki/Legate_Rikke_(Skyrim),"Legate Rikke is the chief legate of the Imperial Legion under General Tullius. Rikke is a Nord, and believes strongly that Skyrim should be part of the Empire.
Rikke is with General Tullius in Castle Dour discussing concerns about Whiterun and Jarl Balgruuf the Greater joining their side in the Civil War before the Dragonborn speaks to her regarding joining the Legion, and she dispatches him to clear out Fort Hraggstad of the bandits occupying it so a detachment of Legionnaires can garrison it to secure the western approach to Solitude from the northern coast along the Ghost Sea. Once done, she directs him to General Tullius to be administered the oath to join the Legion.
Rikke is present with Imperial soldiers, among them Hadvar, during the search for the Jagged Crown in Korvanjund to acquire it before the Stormcloaks can for Galmar Stone-Fist, dealing with both the Stormcloaks and draugr who were disturbed by their trespassing in the tomb.
Rikke leads the charge for the battle against the Stormcloaks composing of herself, Hadvar, Imperial Legionnaires, and Whiterun Hold Guards to protect Whiterun from being taken by Ulfric's Stormcloak soldiers and generals while the city is besieged by catapult fire from the Whiterun Stormcloak Camp while catapults in the city return fire.
Rikke is at the Imperial Camp in The Pale to prepare for taking the hold back from Stormcloak control under Jarl Skald the Elder. To do so, she has the Dragonborn ambush a Stormcloak courier so she can falsify the documents the courier was carrying before having them delivered to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar, Frorkmar Banner-Torn.
With Frorkmar having been given the false information regarding Fort Dunstad, Rikke assigns the Dragonborn to attack the fort with the Imperial troops and wipe out the Stormcloak garrison so the Legion can take over. Once that is done, The Pale will be placed under Imperial control, with Legate Constantius Tituleius replacing Frorknar in Dawnstar, and Skald the Elder removed from his position as Jarl, replaced by Imperial loyalist Brina Merilis.
Rikke then travels to the Imperial Camp in The Rift, with the intent to blackmail Jarl Laila Law-Giver's steward Anuriel to attain knowledge of a Stormcloak convoy full of weapons and gold that she then has the Dragonborn ambush alongside Hadvar and several other Legionnaires to deny the Stormcloaks the valuables for Ulfric's war effort.
Having captured the convoy, Rikke orders the Dragonborn to assault Fort Greenwall, the main Stormcloak stronghold in The Rift protecting Riften just north of the city with Imperial troops, as it would allow for easier communication with the Imperial City back in Cyrodiil. Once the fort is taken, The Rift will fall under Imperial control, and Stormcloak commander Gonnar Oath-Giver will be replaced by Legate Fasendil at Mistveil Keep in Riften, while Laila will be replaced as Jarl by Maven Black-Briar, a powerful Imperial ally with support from the Thieves Guild.
Rikke is then at the Winterhold Imperial Camp, with the next target being the main Stormcloak stronghold in Winterhold, Fort Kastav, where several Legionnaires are being kept as Stormcloak prisoners of war, or POWs. Sending the Dragonborn to sneak into the fort and free the prisoners, together with Hadvar and several other Legionnaires waiting to attack from outside in a pincer move, Rikke soon learns that the fort has capitulated, placing Winterhold under Imperial control, and replacing Stormcloak commander Kai Wet-Pommel with Legate Sevan Telendas in the capital Winterhold while Jarl Korir is removed from power as well, and is replaced by Kraldar.
Having reclaimed most of the Stormcloak-controlled holds, leaving only Eastmarch, which is Ulfric's home territory, Rikke sends troops from the Eastmarch Imperial Camp to take over Fort Amol, the main Stormcloak stronghold before the Legion can launch their attack on Windhelm. Once the fort is captured, the final assault on Windhelm can begin.
With the final battle to take out Ulfric and his Stormcloaks upon them, Rikke personally joins General Tullius as they lead the attack on Windhelm, before confronting Ulfric and Galmar in the Palace of the Kings, resulting in Galmar and Ulfric's deaths, and the end of the Civil War, placing Legate Hrollod in place of Ulfric's Stormcloak commander for his home territory, Yrsarald Thrice-Pierced, and Brunwulf Free-Winter as Jarl to replace the late Ulfric.
Rikke will join General Tullius and Jarl Elisif for the meeting at High Hrothgar between them and Ulfric with Galmar Stone-Fist. When reaching the point of which an exchange of holds between the two factions is discussed, Ulfric will want control of The Reach. The Dragonborn can choose to exchange it for The Rift, or one of the minor holds under Stormcloak control, though this leaves Rikke disappointed in the unfair trade if a minor hold is traded for The Reach.
Rikke will be at the Falkreath Imperial Camp if Falkreath was given to the Stormcloaks during the meeting at High Hrothgar, requesting that the Dragonborn join the Legionnaires for the assault on Fort Neugrad to reclaim it and the hold from Stormcloak control. Once that is done, Falkreath will be back under Imperial control, and Siddgeir will be reinstated as Jarl in place of Dengeir.
If The Reach was given to the Stormcloaks during the meeting with The Greybeards, Rikke will be at the Reach Imperial Camp, requesting the Dragonborn assault Fort Sungard with her forces and place it back under Imperial control. Once the Stormcloak garrison is eliminated, The Reach will once again be in Imperial hands, with Igmund reinstated as Jarl. This removes the Stormcloak sympathizer Thongvor Silver-Blood of the Silver-Blood Family from the position, thus denying the Stormcloaks control of Cidhna Mine and the silver within.
If Hjaalmarch was given to Ulfric during the negotiations at High Hrothgar, Rikke will be at the Hjaalmarch Imperial Camp, asking the Dragonborn to assist with taking the hold back from the Stormcloaks by attacking the garrison at Fort Snowhawk. Once the fort is cleared of Stormcloak rebels, Hjaalmarch will return to Imperial control and Idgrod Ravencrone will be restored to her position as Jarl.
If the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion, Rikke acts as their commanding officer in the field, and assigns the Dragonborn to recapture several of the major holds. She, along with General Tullius, is present at the Imperial attack on Windhelm, and assists the Dragonborn in the final battle with Ulfric Stormcloak and Galmar Stone-Fist. She also attends the meeting at High Hrothgar when a truce becomes necessary so that the Dragonborn can capture Odahviing and then deal with Alduin once and for all.
If the Dragonborn sides with the Stormcloaks, Rikke is killed while defending Tullius during the Civil War in their final stand in Castle Dour in Solitude. Later, she can be encountered in Sovngarde, where she laments that the Legion wished to protect Skyrim, but only succeeded in killing men and women from both sides who are now being devoured by Alduin. She also laments that this has made her unable to find the way to Shor's Hall. Her coffin can be found in the Solitude Catacombs, along with General Tullius'.
Why do you fight for the Empire? ""I am a loyal citizen of the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and I've followed in their footsteps. But more importantly, I am a daughter of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again.""
What will it take to end the war? ""I hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to stop now. Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt.""

/wiki/Lurbuk,"Lurbuk is an Orsimer bard and can be found in Moorside Inn, in the city of Morthal.
A graduate of the prestigious Bards College in Solitude, Lurbuk has quite the reputation in Skyrim: he is widely acknowledged as the absolute worst bard in all of Tamriel.
The innkeeper is also not a fan of Lurbuk, but allows him to continue playing because ""business is so slow.""
His daily schedule involves playing at the inn during the day and periodically taking breaks. He also sleeps at the inn.
It seems that due to his terrible reputation as a bard, several parties have requested for him to be assassinated. In fact, Nazir claims that Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine whose request would be honored.

/wiki/Lydia_(Skyrim),"Lydia is a Nord housecarl obtained upon completion of the quest ""Dragon Rising."" She receives the title of Housecarl from Balgruuf the Greater in Dragonsreach,[1] immediately after the Dragonborn is promoted to the title of Thane. As Housecarl, she is sworn to protect the Dragonborn with her life, and to carry their burdens.[2] She is a follower, as well as a marriage candidate for the Dragonborn.
Just like other followers, Lydia can die if she does not get the opportunity to heal herself when knocked down. This can happen if the Dragonborn damages her at low health.
If the Dragonborn and Lydia part ways, she returns to Dragonsreach. If Breezehome in Whiterun is owned, she will return there instead. If enough time was spent with her, she may gift the Dragonborn with a radiant item upon reuniting with her.
Lydia, like most followers, has the option of being recruited into The Blades by being brought to Delphine at Sky Haven Temple after the quest Alduin's Wall is completed. She can still be recruited as a follower, but her default Steel apparel will be replaced with a full set of Blades Armor and a Blades sword. This change is permanent.[3]
Before Patch 1.5, it was only possible to marry Lydia through console commands. If the Dragonborn does marry her, then she opens a shop in town and gives the Dragonborn 100  per day. She can be asked to move to a different house, if a house other than Breezehome is owned. Like all the other candidates for marriage, she will cook a Homecooked Meal once a day that regenerates Stamina, Health, and Magicka. She can only be married once Breezehome has been purchased.
Lydia is primarily a melee-type character and uses no spells. As with some other melee-oriented followers, she has tendency to simply rush into combat, possibly leading to her death.
She can use spell scrolls and staves, potions and food if available, and favors Heavy Armor and One-Handed weapons, but will use any equipment if it bests the current base armor or damage rating.
She also has very low Sneak skill, alerting enemies of her presence nearly immediately. This may cause problems if the Dragonborn has low Sneak skill, but may prove as an advantage if the Dragonborn has a higher Sneak level, since it allows the Dragonborn to lure enemies using Lydia. Although her Sneak skill isn't high enough to have the perk to do this, she can sometimes be seen doing a roll (when the Dragonborn is crouching) in order to catch up.
Lydia's default armor is steel armor (the version without pauldrons), boots, gauntlets, and shield. Her default equipment provides a total armor rating of 169. She does not wear a helmet by default, but can equip any if given one. She can also wear any ring or necklace given to her by the Dragonborn, which can be useful due to the added effects these items may have. She can equip armor given to her, if its armor rating surpasses that of her default equipment. She can and will wear light armor, but her high Heavy Armor skill makes it difficult without a high Smithing skill or high-end armor, or the ""equipitem"" console command.
It should be noted that, similar to other followers, there are multiple options to change her gear. She may be dismissed then pickpocketed to remove her default gear using the Perfect Touch Pickpocket perk. Alternatively, she may be married so that she opens a shop — this then allows the Dragonborn to buy her default clothes, which forces her to wear alternative gear.
She only uses a shield if the best melee weapon in her inventory is One-Handed, otherwise she uses a Two-Handed weapon. Lydia's default weapon is a steel sword. If her sword is removed or if opponents are out of melee range, she uses a hunting bow, with an infinite supply of iron arrows, though these arrows cannot be taken from her inventory. Similar to her melee weapon and armor, she can be given stronger arrows and a stronger bow, which she will use instead.
With Dragonborn, Lydia has been updated with a set of quotes unique to her, making her much more expressive than before. She may comment on various locations in both Skyrim and Solstheim.",Lydia,Female Even Toned,FemaleEvenToned,Nord,Female,,666772,666766

If the Dragonborn pursues the Thieves Guild questline, then, at one point, the Dragonborn will deliver moon sugar to Ri'saad. Doing so will unlock all Khajiit trading caravan merchants as fences for stolen goods.
Ysolda tells the Dragonborn that Ma'dran told her that if she could bring a Mammoth Tusk to him, he will help her. The Dragonborn can aid Ysolda in this quest.
If Malborn survives after ""Diplomatic Immunity,"" he will be found hiding in the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm from the Khajiit Thalmor assassin, J'datharr. Ma'ran may be found near the assassin outside the city and the Dragonborn may ask about J'datharr being part of his caravans.
Has the war made your travels difficult? ""Quite the opposite, in fact. The soldiers are some of our best customers, for we offer supplies and wares they cannot obtain by other means.

/wiki/Madanach,"Madanach, also known as The King in Rags, is the leader of the Forsworn Rebellion. He is imprisoned in Cidhna Mine, deep beneath the city of Markarth.
Before Madanach allows the Dragonborn to escape the mine with the rest of the Forsworn, he will require the disposal of Grisvar the Unlucky, as Grisvar has been in and out of Cidhna Mine, possibly leaking information, and thus is suspected of being a spy. With Grisvar dead, Madanach and his followers plan to escape through a tunnel they have been digging under Markarth, leading eventually to the city's surface. Upon reaching the surface, Madanach will give a speech to his followers, after which a battle will ensue between the Hold Guards and his men.
Once the battle concludes, Madanach and his followers will retreat to the Druadach Redoubt.
If the Dragonborn decides to kill Madanach before escaping the mine, the remaining prisoners will become hostile. One can then use Madanach's Key to escape through the tunnel next to Madanach's quarters. Thonar will meet the Dragonborn at the entrance to the Markarth Ruins, reward them with the Silver-Blood Family Ring, then he will inform them that they have done a great service to the Silver-Blood family and that they have been pardoned by the Jarl of Markarth.
Upon helping Madanach escape and choosing not to kill him at Thonar's behest, Madanach will reward the Dragonborn with the Armor of the Old Gods.
The ""King in Rags"" proves to be a strong-willed and shrewd character, totally dedicated to his cause. He is no stranger to murder, as long as he expels the Nords and regains the Reach for his fellow Forsworn. He has a particular distaste for outsiders too, being hostile to the Dragonborn in their first meeting. Madanach shows absolute belief in his cause, he fully believes what he is doing is right and the Nords are evil, and that the Forsworn are the only legitimate rulers of the Reach.
Madanach shows a talent for manipulation and cunning. In the shadows, he lures Thonar into a false sense of security before striking at him and Markarth, with the right agents in place. He forces the player to kill the loose end, Grisvar, who could be disloyal. Honeyed words and speeches are his specialities, as he attempts to convert the Dragonborn and justify his cause. He empowers those who follow him and seeks to win through slyness what brute force cannot obtain. He fancies himself to be ruthless and cunning, although he reveals that all he really wants is the peace they had before Ulfric's attack.
If the Dragonborn decides to attack and slay Madanach, they should take caution. If attacked in his cell, the Dragonborn will have little equipment, the only available weapons, aside from magic, being a pickaxe or a shiv. This is the same for Madanach, and he has magic on his side as well. If confronted directly, he can invoke a Frost Cloak spell. He will also hurl Fireballs and Ice Spikes relentlessly if the Dragonborn is within range. A sneak attack may be the best course. Magic users will have a much easier time with this battle, as they don't have to get close to the Frost Cloak. Shouts are also very useful, as a single Fire Breath shout with all three words of power may result in an instant kill at lower levels.
Slaying Madanach after aiding him will make his followers hostile, too. At this stage, some may have been killed by the enemies in the ruins. One may or may not have recovered their equipment by then, so this may vary in difficulty. Avoid being surrounded, as some of the other prisoners have magic of their own. Madanach will also have improved and enchanted gear if the Dragonborn's equipment has been recovered.
Beast form or Vampire Lord Form may prove useful as it requires no equipment to use.
I talked to Braig. ""Imagine hearing a story like that, over and over. Each time a different family. Each time a different injustice.

/wiki/Malacath,"Malacath (Daedric: ), sometimes called Malak, Orkey,[1] The Blue God,[2] or Mauloch,[3] is the Daedric Prince of vengeance[source?], the spurned and the ostracized, the keeper of the Sworn Oath, and the Bloody Curse.[4]
Malacath is a Daedric Prince, patron god of the Orsimer,[5] and member of the House of Troubles in Dunmeri theology.[6]. Malacath's teachings put a large emphasis on conflict,[7] and he seems to enjoy watching mortals fight one another.
The summoning date of Malacath is 8th of Frost Fall. However, Malacath can also be summoned at his shrine, if the summoner offers Troll Fat.[8]
The Ashpit is Malacath's plane of Oblivion.[9] While typically seen as a desolate and unwelcoming place, this spartan landscape is considered a good thing in orc religion, and that orcs who revere Malacath reside in the Ashen Forge, a place of perpetual feasting, drinking and battle, where every orc is a chief, and has many wives.[10] The Backbone of Ashpit has also been called an actual backbone, alluding to the possibility that Ashpit may be made from Malacath himself.[11]
Malacath was created when Trinimac attempted to stop the Chimer from leaving the Summerset Isles. Boethiah, who was the mastermind behind the exodus, confronted Trinimac. Details of the account vary, with some claiming Boethiah swallowed Trinimac and spoke with his voice to encourage and teach the Chimer while at the same time mocking the opposed Aldmer, before excreting Trinimac out and the remains becoming Malacath.[12] His followers then became the orcs, who fled from the Isles in shame.[1] However, when Attrebus Mede told this story to Malacath disguised as an old woman, the Prince remarked that, ""[y]ou people are always so literal-minded"", indicating that this may not be the whole truth.[13]
The Daggerfall Covenant calls this version of events ""anti-orc propaganda"".[14] The orcs tell a tale whereby Trinimac was defeated by the treachery of Boethiah and Mephala, and cast into the Ashpit by a curse. Trinimac then tore the shame from his skin, and was reborn as Malacath thanks to that disfigurement and shedding of blood.[15]
Malacath, as summoned in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.
The Hero of Daggerfall received Malacath's hammer, Volendrung, around 3E 417, after he dealt with a troublesome Daedra Seducer for the Daedric Prince.[16] After wandering throughout Tamriel, the hammer returned to Morrowind and came to be in the possession of Yagrum Bagarn, the last living Dwemer, who had the hammer in his closet.[17] At that time all the enchantments on the hammer had vanished, for no apparent reason. It was just a mundane hammer. However, in 3E 433 the hammer came into the possession of Malacath again, and all its powerful enchantments returned.[18] Volendrung is best known for the paralyzing and strength leeching effects it has when hitting an enemy.[19]
Malacath's mace Scourge was found in the Battlespire during time of the Imperial Simulacrum.[20] It changed owners, and finally the mace came to the possession of the Telvanni lord, Divayth Fyr. As any of Fyr's artifacts, it was free for the thieves to steal – if they could. It might have passed into the hands of the Nerevarine.[17]
Gortwog gro-Nagorm was an orc leader and the founder of Orsinium the Orc Capital established in 3E 399.[21] Gortwog gro-Nagorm created controversy among orcs because he accused Malacath of being a false god and created a priesthood dedicated to Trinimac the ancient champion of the Aedra. This view contradicted the common belief that Malacath was Trinimac after he was devoured by Boethiah. Gortwog believed that Trinimac was still alive and that Malacath was a demon. His views were regarded as heresy by most orcs.[22]
During the Umbriel crisis, Prince Attrebus and Sul confronted Vuhon in Umbriel. They discovered Vuhon could not be defeated without recovering the Umbra Sword. Sul noticed that Vuhon had mentioned that Umbriel was part of Oblivion, so he opened a gate so that Attrebus and him could escape. They ended up in another Oblivion plane.
When Attrebus woke up, he was greeted by female elf. The woman told Attrebus she was Silhansa, and that they were in Malacath's realm. Silhansa had healed Attrebus' wounds. Attrebus was shocked that she was naked. Her hair was rosy gold, her skin alabaster white, and her eyes twin emeralds. She had the slender, pointed ears of an elf.
Attrebus told Silhansa about his adventure to stop Umbriel from destroying Tamriel. He also told her about a tale he had heard about Malacath while he was seven years old. When he finished, Silhansa started to grow, and she transformed into Malacath. Malacath now held both Attrebus and Sul in his hands. Malacath reveals that Sul had sworn an oath to him once. Attrebus manages to convince Malacath to release them and teleport them to Solstheim so that Sul could fulfill his oath. Before leaving his realm Malacath told Attrebus that if he ever had use for him, the prince would know it.[23]
Despite his ferocity, Malacath is genuinely caring towards his followers. He refers to his enslaved Ogre followers as his ""little brothers"" and ensures their safety.[18] He has also been known to curse orc chiefs for their negligence.[24] Malacath also allegedly showed sorrow over the death of his mortal son.[25]
Malacath is one of the Dunmer Four Corners of the House of Troubles, gods that are sent to test the Dunmer in various ways by inflicting trials upon them.[6] Malacath, or Malak, is considered to be a god-king who tests the Dunmer for physical weakness[26] He is also a demon for the Nords, who typically refer to him as Mauloch.[27]
During the time of the Nerevarine, Malacath was summoned by the Nerevarine in his Shrine of Assurdirapal. The Prince of Curses asked the Nerevarine to track and kill the last of the Oreyn Bearclaw family line. He was upset that Oreyn Bearclaw took all the glory of a hero while in fact all the deeds were done by Kharag gro-Khar, Oreyn's Orcish companion. The target was finally killed by the Nerevarine and Malacath rewarded him the Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw. However Malacath was wrong in believing that the Oreyn Bearclaw's family line had ended, as one of the family members was still alive. This person, named Modryn Oreyn, became a rather important person in the Fighters Guild after his role in the quest to eliminate the dangerous competitor of the guild, the Blackwood Company.
Malacath's quest in Cyrodiil involves the Hero of Kvatch's rescue of another group of outcasts, namely, a group of enslaved Ogres. He requires an offering of Troll Fat, and the Hero must be level 10 to start the quest. He will send them to the Home of Lord Drad, the slave owner, with instructions to free the Ogres without harming them. After speaking with Lord Drad and then his wife, an easy way to complete this quest is to simply walk into the mine and ignore the guards. As long as they are not attacked, they will tolerate the Hero's presence, and in a simple manner, go to the two Ogre cages and pick the locks of each of the cell doors. Once freed the Ogres and the guards will fight each other, leaving the Hero to simply pick what he likes from the dead bodies of the fallen. Neither side will attack the Hero as long as he remains passive, and even if one or more of the guards survive they will not care as the Hero loots the chests throughout the mine. Note that even if all the Ogres are killed during the battle with the guards, this will not affect the outcome of the quest.
As a reward for finishing the quest, Malacath gives the Hero Volendrung, his enchanted two-handed warhammer.
In Skyrim, an Orc named Atub asks the Dragonborn to bring her troll fat and a Daedra heart so that she can pray to Malacath to end the curse he put on her tribe. After doing so, Atub suggests that Yamarz the chief and the Dragonborn join in the summoning. Yamarz begrudgingly accepts, and Atub begins the ceremony. Malacath then speaks to Yamarz and he commands Yamarz to go and bring back a warhammer. Yamarz orders the Dragonborn to come along with him, stating that the Dragonborn got him into this mess. At the shrine, Yamarz will say that he will pay the Dragonborn to kill the giant. The Dragonborn can accept the deal, but Yamarz will betray them. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can let Yamarz attempt to kill the giant. The chief may die in the process, unless the Dragonborn helps kill the giant. If Yamarz survives, he will betray the Dragonborn in order to claim sole credit for killing the giant. Regardless, once the giant and Yamarz are dead, Malacath speaks again telling the Dragonborn to take Shagrol's Warhammer back to the stronghold. The Dragonborn can either lie to Atub and conceal Yamarz's cowardice/betrayal or reveal the truth of his fate. Malacath speaks once more telling the tribe that they have earned a second chance and appoints a new chief from within the stronghold. Finally, he tells the Dragonborn they have earned his favor with their valorous conduct and to place Shagrol's Warhammer on the shrine to accept their reward. The hammer then transforms into Volendrung.",Malacath,Male Nord,MaleNord,Nord,Male,,1032601,1032600

Malacath's mace Scourge was found in the Battlespire during time of the Imperial Simulacrum.[20] It changed owners, and finally the mace came to the possession of the Telvanni lord, Divayth Fyr. As any of Fyr's artifacts, it was free for the thieves to steal – if they could. It might have passed into the hands of the Nerevarine.[17]
Gortwog gro-Nagorm was an orc leader and the founder of Orsinium the Orc Capital established in 3E 399.[21] Gortwog gro-Nagorm created controversy among orcs because he accused Malacath of being a false god and created a priesthood dedicated to Trinimac the ancient champion of the Aedra. This view contradicted the common belief that Malacath was Trinimac after he was devoured by Boethiah. Gortwog believed that Trinimac was still alive and that Malacath was a demon. His views were regarded as heresy by most orcs.[22]
During the Umbriel crisis, Prince Attrebus and Sul confronted Vuhon in Umbriel. They discovered Vuhon could not be defeated without recovering the Umbra Sword. Sul noticed that Vuhon had mentioned that Umbriel was part of Oblivion, so he opened a gate so that Attrebus and him could escape. They ended up in another Oblivion plane.
When Attrebus woke up, he was greeted by female elf. The woman told Attrebus she was Silhansa, and that they were in Malacath's realm. Silhansa had healed Attrebus' wounds. Attrebus was shocked that she was naked. Her hair was rosy gold, her skin alabaster white, and her eyes twin emeralds. She had the slender, pointed ears of an elf.
Attrebus told Silhansa about his adventure to stop Umbriel from destroying Tamriel. He also told her about a tale he had heard about Malacath while he was seven years old. When he finished, Silhansa started to grow, and she transformed into Malacath. Malacath now held both Attrebus and Sul in his hands. Malacath reveals that Sul had sworn an oath to him once. Attrebus manages to convince Malacath to release them and teleport them to Solstheim so that Sul could fulfill his oath. Before leaving his realm Malacath told Attrebus that if he ever had use for him, the prince would know it.[23]
Despite his ferocity, Malacath is genuinely caring towards his followers. He refers to his enslaved Ogre followers as his ""little brothers"" and ensures their safety.[18] He has also been known to curse orc chiefs for their negligence.[24] Malacath also allegedly showed sorrow over the death of his mortal son.[25]
Malacath is one of the Dunmer Four Corners of the House of Troubles, gods that are sent to test the Dunmer in various ways by inflicting trials upon them.[6] Malacath, or Malak, is considered to be a god-king who tests the Dunmer for physical weakness[26] He is also a demon for the Nords, who typically refer to him as Mauloch.[27]
During the time of the Nerevarine, Malacath was summoned by the Nerevarine in his Shrine of Assurdirapal. The Prince of Curses asked the Nerevarine to track and kill the last of the Oreyn Bearclaw family line. He was upset that Oreyn Bearclaw took all the glory of a hero while in fact all the deeds were done by Kharag gro-Khar, Oreyn's Orcish companion. The target was finally killed by the Nerevarine and Malacath rewarded him the Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw. However Malacath was wrong in believing that the Oreyn Bearclaw's family line had ended, as one of the family members was still alive. This person, named Modryn Oreyn, became a rather important person in the Fighters Guild after his role in the quest to eliminate the dangerous competitor of the guild, the Blackwood Company.
Malacath's quest in Cyrodiil involves the Hero of Kvatch's rescue of another group of outcasts, namely, a group of enslaved Ogres. He requires an offering of Troll Fat, and the Hero must be level 10 to start the quest. He will send them to the Home of Lord Drad, the slave owner, with instructions to free the Ogres without harming them. After speaking with Lord Drad and then his wife, an easy way to complete this quest is to simply walk into the mine and ignore the guards. As long as they are not attacked, they will tolerate the Hero's presence, and in a simple manner, go to the two Ogre cages and pick the locks of each of the cell doors. Once freed the Ogres and the guards will fight each other, leaving the Hero to simply pick what he likes from the dead bodies of the fallen. Neither side will attack the Hero as long as he remains passive, and even if one or more of the guards survive they will not care as the Hero loots the chests throughout the mine. Note that even if all the Ogres are killed during the battle with the guards, this will not affect the outcome of the quest.
As a reward for finishing the quest, Malacath gives the Hero Volendrung, his enchanted two-handed warhammer.
In Skyrim, an Orc named Atub asks the Dragonborn to bring her troll fat and a Daedra heart so that she can pray to Malacath to end the curse he put on her tribe. After doing so, Atub suggests that Yamarz the chief and the Dragonborn join in the summoning. Yamarz begrudgingly accepts, and Atub begins the ceremony. Malacath then speaks to Yamarz and he commands Yamarz to go and bring back a warhammer. Yamarz orders the Dragonborn to come along with him, stating that the Dragonborn got him into this mess. At the shrine, Yamarz will say that he will pay the Dragonborn to kill the giant. The Dragonborn can accept the deal, but Yamarz will betray them. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can let Yamarz attempt to kill the giant. The chief may die in the process, unless the Dragonborn helps kill the giant. If Yamarz survives, he will betray the Dragonborn in order to claim sole credit for killing the giant. Regardless, once the giant and Yamarz are dead, Malacath speaks again telling the Dragonborn to take Shagrol's Warhammer back to the stronghold. The Dragonborn can either lie to Atub and conceal Yamarz's cowardice/betrayal or reveal the truth of his fate. Malacath speaks once more telling the tribe that they have earned a second chance and appoints a new chief from within the stronghold. Finally, he tells the Dragonborn they have earned his favor with their valorous conduct and to place Shagrol's Warhammer on the shrine to accept their reward. The hammer then transforms into Volendrung.",Malacath,Male Nord,MaleNord,Nord,Male,,1032601,1032600
/wiki/Malacath,"Malacath (Daedric: ), sometimes called Malak, Orkey,[1] The Blue God,[2] or Mauloch,[3] is the Daedric Prince of vengeance[source?], the spurned and the ostracized, the keeper of the Sworn Oath, and the Bloody Curse.[4]
Malacath is a Daedric Prince, patron god of the Orsimer,[5] and member of the House of Troubles in Dunmeri theology.[6]. Malacath's teachings put a large emphasis on conflict,[7] and he seems to enjoy watching mortals fight one another.
The summoning date of Malacath is 8th of Frost Fall. However, Malacath can also be summoned at his shrine, if the summoner offers Troll Fat.[8]
The Ashpit is Malacath's plane of Oblivion.[9] While typically seen as a desolate and unwelcoming place, this spartan landscape is considered a good thing in orc religion, and that orcs who revere Malacath reside in the Ashen Forge, a place of perpetual feasting, drinking and battle, where every orc is a chief, and has many wives.[10] The Backbone of Ashpit has also been called an actual backbone, alluding to the possibility that Ashpit may be made from Malacath himself.[11]
Malacath was created when Trinimac attempted to stop the Chimer from leaving the Summerset Isles. Boethiah, who was the mastermind behind the exodus, confronted Trinimac. Details of the account vary, with some claiming Boethiah swallowed Trinimac and spoke with his voice to encourage and teach the Chimer while at the same time mocking the opposed Aldmer, before excreting Trinimac out and the remains becoming Malacath.[12] His followers then became the orcs, who fled from the Isles in shame.[1] However, when Attrebus Mede told this story to Malacath disguised as an old woman, the Prince remarked that, ""[y]ou people are always so literal-minded"", indicating that this may not be the whole truth.[13]
The Daggerfall Covenant calls this version of events ""anti-orc propaganda"".[14] The orcs tell a tale whereby Trinimac was defeated by the treachery of Boethiah and Mephala, and cast into the Ashpit by a curse. Trinimac then tore the shame from his skin, and was reborn as Malacath thanks to that disfigurement and shedding of blood.[15]

The Hero of Daggerfall received Malacath's hammer, Volendrung, around 3E 417, after he dealt with a troublesome Daedra Seducer for the Daedric Prince.[16] After wandering throughout Tamriel, the hammer returned to Morrowind and came to be in the possession of Yagrum Bagarn, the last living Dwemer, who had the hammer in his closet.[17] At that time all the enchantments on the hammer had vanished, for no apparent reason. It was just a mundane hammer. However, in 3E 433 the hammer came into the possession of Malacath again, and all its powerful enchantments returned.[18] Volendrung is best known for the paralyzing and strength leeching effects it has when hitting an enemy.[19]

This is most likely so the Dragonborn does not get discovered as an infiltrator and spy by the Altmer ambassador. When asked for a drink, Malborn will instead tell the Dragonborn to cause a distraction, so the Dragonborn can slip into the embassy unnoticed. Once inside, Malborn will blackmail the cook not to report both the Dragonborn and himself. He will then guide the player to a chest containing the equipment he smuggled in earlier on in the quest. From this point onwards, the Dragonborn no longer receives any more help from Malborn as he needs to get back to the party before Elenwen or her Altmer guards become suspicious.
After infiltrating the Solar and finding a prisoner, two Thalmor guards will enter the dungeon with Malborn in custody. His cover was blown. If Malborn survives, he will go to the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm, joined by Brelas if she had been captured by the Thalmor as well as part of the earlier distraction at the party and survives the escape as well.
If he is kept alive during your escape, Malborn can be found in the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm. He says he wishes to escape to Morrowind, but believes the Thalmor have sent a Khajiit named J'datharr to assassinate him. If you kill J'datharr he will award the player a leveled amount of gold and leave Windhelm. When followed, he disappears when he reaches the Decree of Monument at Refugees' Rest, which means he has crossed the Skyrim-Morrowind border into Morrowind. Though if there are enemies present along the way, he will likely be killed.",Malborn,Male Even Toned,MaleEvenToned,Wood Elf,Male,,212806,221588
/wiki/Malkoran,"Malkoran is a Breton conjurer in the Kilkreath Ruins. He stole Dawnbreaker from Meridia and used its power to create an army of corrupted shades. He is the primary antagonist of the quest ""The Break of Dawn.""
Enemy of the Daedric Lord Meridia, Malkoran is one of the most powerful wizards in Skyrim, and his combination of Destruction and Restoration spells are amongst the toughest for the Dragonborn to go up against. He will arm himself with a Steadfast Ward nearly every time they use a Destruction spell of their own or a shout, plus a Fast Healing spell should his health be lowered.
Also, Malkoran will unleash a pair of frost-related Destruction spells, Icy Spear and Ice Storm. Once he is killed, his shade will emerge from his recently killed corpse and will unleash powerful attacks.
Upon obtaining the beacon, which is a large gem with no value, Meridia commands the Dragonborn to take the beacon to the shrine located west of Solitude, directly north of the Haafingar Stormcloak Camp. Once there, Meridia will tell the Dragonborn that there is a powerful necromancer named Malkoran defiling her temple, whom the Dragonborn must destroy.",Malkoran,Male Warlock,MaleWarlock,Breton,Male,,171399,641894

Due to his race, Jarl Korir has assumed that Malur has ties to the College of Winterhold, and therefore employs him as steward, despite Seloth being a slouch with no marketable skills. However, unlike most stewards, he continues to serve as steward if the balance of power shifts to the Imperials.
If questioned about what he does as steward, Malur replies, ""Me? Nothing. And I hope to keep it that way.""

/wiki/Malyn_Varen,"Malyn Varen is a Dunmer mage located within Azura's Star. He is the primary antagonist of the quest ""The Black Star.""
Years ago, Malyn was exiled from the College of Winterhold for pursuing controversial research with Soul Gems, killing a student, and many other unacceptable experiments. He sought to find a way to become immortal, and he believed that storing his soul in Azura's Star would prevent him from dying. The problem with this is that one of the properties of the star is that no humanoid soul could enter.
According to Nelacar, the further Malyn progressed towards his goal, the more Azura cursed him. The Daedric artifact drove Malyn insane, causing him to hallucinate: he ""heard voices"" that were not there, saw people that were not there, and eventually, even murdered one of his students. For this, he was expelled, whereupon he gathered a band of followers, and continued his research at Ilinalta's Deep, an abandoned Imperial outpost that collapsed into the lake due to earlier experiments by Malyn and his accomplices.
There, he sought to capture his own soul in the Star to achieve a state of immortality. He achieved this goal to some extent, however he must continually be ""fed"" souls from the outside world to continue his state of existence. This was the purpose of the necromancers stationed in the sunken outpost, and the appearance of so many skeletons within suggest they had been doing it for quite some time.
The Dragonborn finds Azura's Star beside Malyn's skeleton at Ilinalta's Deep, and with the help of Azura, purifies it by entering it and purging Malyn's soul.
Alternatively, the Dragonborn may have brought the Star to Nelacar and had him perform the purification, which causes the Star to turn black and trap black souls within it, similar to a Black Soul Gem.
Even when the star is cleansed however, an unknown adversary sends two apprentice necromancers to hunt down the Dragonborn and reclaim Azura's Star.
The staff and dagger that Malyn wield are leveled and random. Occasionally throughout the fight, he switches to casting Oakflesh.
Fighting alongside him are three Dremora. While the Dremoras' fire spells do a lot of damage, and make them hard to see, they are not difficult to drain and kill if they are approached enough. As long as the Dragonborn has good fire shielding and/or a lot of health potions, the battle can be fought long enough to kill them. Using a full strength Slow Time shout while he is attempting to run away after the initial conversation allows him to be easily defeated.
For a magic-based character, a Dovahkiin sufficiently skilled in Conjuration can summon a pair of Storm Atronachs or Thralls, whose attacks can easily drain the Dremora's magicka, rendering them vulnerable to melee attacks.
As for thief-type characters, with a high enough Sneak skill, even without the Shadow Warrior Perk, it is possible to stay crouching behind a crystal pillar, out of view of Malyn and the Dremora, and become hidden again, and backstab all four of them, by sneaking up on each of them individually. This is best done with the Mehrune's Razor, a set of Ancient Shrouded Armor, and, if the player is an Orsimer, the Berserker power active. The Dragonborn must also have unlocked Assassin's Blade to achieve the maximum damage. 
Three Daedra Hearts can be collected once the Dremora have been slain, but only if their corpses were not knocked off the edges of the crystalline floor during battle. They also carry leveled (possibly difficulty dependent if not random) one and two-handed weaponry. A way to even the odds is to dual-wield the Staff of Magnus with a Staff of Sparks, draining their health and magical capabilities simultaenously.
Malyn can be resurrected using the Dead Thrall Conjuration spell. He will not initially follow the Dragonborn out of the Azura Star, but he later reappears after fast-traveling.",Malyn Varen,Male Dunmer,MaleDarkElf,Dark Elf,Male,,166613,166611

Marcurio is a mage who is feisty and sassy, saying things such as ""Try not to walk into any spike-filled pits or filthy skeever dens."" 
He is very interested in Dwemer culture and technology, though he admits he would like them more were they not constantly trying to kill him. When in ancient Nordic tombs, he reflects on his seemingly extensive knowledge of Nordic culture and history.
Marcurio specializes in Destruction spells. He also prefers to use his default robes, refusing to equip any other type of robe given to him, though he equips any armor given to him. Like many other followers, he has a hunting bow with 12 iron arrows, which he will use when out of magicka. He will equip any weapon, as long as it is stronger than his (leveled) dagger. However, he prefers to use spells over weapons, which he will use only rarely.
His favored spells are shock-based, and will use fire as a back-up, though he often has a shock spell in one hand and firebolt in the other. When fighting undead (such as draugr), he utilizes the Turn Undead spell. In addition, Marcurio can use any staves placed in his inventory.
Marcurio leaves a sum of money to the Dragonborn if he dies while in their service. The amount is 300  by default, but increases the longer he is a follower.

/wiki/Margret,"Margret is a Nordic spy of the Imperial Legion, visiting Markarth.
Hailing from the Imperial City, Margret claims she came to Markarth looking to purchase jewelry for her sister. She rented the most expensive room at the Silver-Blood Inn for a month. Later she revealed herself to be an agent sent by General Tullius, in order to investigate the treasury house and the Silver-Blood family.
Upon the Dragonborn's first visit to Markarth, a Breton named Weylin attempts to murder her and a silversmith named Kerah. If the Dragonborn succeeds in preventing the murder, she pays them with articles of jewelry and her questionable presence in Markarth is left to be investigated further.
After the assassination attempt, successful or not, Eltrys will give the Dragonborn a note asking the Dragonborn to rendezvous with him in the Temple of Talos. Following through with the request, the Dragonborn learns of a conspiracy with the Forsworn, a cult of killers that have infiltrated the guards and received support from the Silver-Blood Family.
Eltrys employs the Dragonborn with investigating Margret's attack and the motives behind it. Learning that she purchased a room at the Silver-Blood Inn, the Dragonborn either finds the key to her room on her corpse in the market or pickpockets it from Kleppr, the innkeeper. Alternatively, the room can be infiltrated using lockpicks.

/wiki/Maurice_Jondrelle,"Maurice Jondrelle is a Breton pilgrim who is visiting many of the holy sites across Skyrim. He is involved in the quest The Blessings of Nature.
He approaches the Dragonborn after overhearing the conversation with Priestess Danica Pure-Spring about going to the Eldergleam Sanctuary. He asks to go along, but it is optional as to whether or not to allow it. He has no armor or weapons, cannot be told to ""wait"" before a fight, and can be killed. However, if taken along, he has a possible impact on the outcome of the quest. Upon witnessing the player's ""violence"" against the Eldergleam Tree's roots with Nettlebane, he offers a second option. Rather than take the sap from the tree forcefully, he prays to it and is given an Eldergleam Sapling. This avoids having to fight the Spriggans.
Maurice is one of the quest characters that can be exploited to follow the Dragonborn throughout Skyrim along with another follower. It should however be noted that while he will indeed follow and aid in fights, he cannot be commanded or equipped. He fights barehanded or with weapons he finds (he prefers greatswords), and can die in battle (as is the case with Enmon). This can be avoided by 'reverse pickpocketing' him and placing tempered, enchanted armor, ring, necklace, and weapons (bows and arrows also), and atronach staves in his inventory. (Note: This can only be done before conversing with him in that he will approach and speak to the Dragonborn and therefore the player must press the exit conversation button to continue planting equipment on him, otherwise he is unable to be pickpocketed.)
Just like Enmon, and Brother Verulus, Maurice can equip a set of any planted heavy armor that's not equipped on the chest (except that Iron Chest Armor works) and so any Light Chest Armor can be planted on him. He will equip his weapon as soon as he finishes his dialogue, but he will only equip his armor after exiting the Temple of Kynareth. His health does not regenerate but he can be healed with Healing Hands, Heal Other or Grand Healing. Without giving him enchanted gear that boosts his health, magicka, stamina, and their regens, this makes him one of the worst followers, more so than Fjotra, who cannot die due to being a child. A more tedious alternative would be to equip him with a weapon that has a high Absorb Health enchantment.",Maurice Jondrelle,Male Condescending,MaleCondescending,Breton,Male,,116230,116229
/wiki/Maven_Black-Briar,"Maven Black-Briar is a Nord and the matriarch of clan Black-Briar. She will become Jarl of The Rift if the Imperial Legion occupies Riften.
According to Mjoll the Lioness, Maven has strong ties with the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild, making her the most influential person in Riften. When asked about her influence, Maven claims that she has Jarl Laila Law-Giver and the Riften Guard in her pocket. She is able to influence the outcome of any situation with money or by exploiting the fear that her allies will retaliate.
The matriarch of the Black-Briar family, Maven is virtually unapproachable and elitist. She holds the actual pulse of Riften in her crushing grip and is not above using unscrupulous methods to ensure things go her way. Anyone who crosses her typically ends up dead or in prison, even members of her own family, such as Sibbi Black-Briar.
If she does not become Jarl, she can be found in various places about Riften, including the marketplace, Black-Briar Meadery, the Bee and Barb, and Black-Briar Manor.
Maven is the mother of Hemming, Ingun, and Sibbi. Maul is her right-hand-man, and enforces her will in the city. He tells the Dragonborn not to stir up trouble with the Black-Briars. Extremely subservient to Maven, Maul will do whatever she asks of him without question.
There is conflicting information about Maven's relationship with the rest of her family. Mjoll refers to Hemming, Ingun, and Sibbi as Maven's children, and Maven has a conversation with Ingun during which each identifies the other by familial relationship. However, Hemming says that Ingun and Sibbi are his children. This can support the theory that Hemming was originally written to be Maven's husband, but was changed to her son later in the development of the game. Or simply Hemming is Maven's son and had two other children with her. In the Creation Kit Maven is set as Hemming's mother and the grandmother of both Sibbi and Ingun.
Maven becomes Jarl if the Imperial Legion gains control of Riften. She will appoint Hemming as her steward and Maul as her housecarl. If the Dragonborn sided with the Stormcloaks, and gave Riften to the Empire in ""Season Unending,"" then retakes it for the Stormcloaks later, Maven, Hemming and Maul will not be exiled; they will simply resume their daily routine. This is likely due to Maven's level of influence in Riften and the rest of Skyrim, and because several quests in the Thieves Guild storyline make it necessary for her to be in Riften.
In Anuriel's chambers, a note from Maven reveals that she had her son Sibbi imprisoned for unknown reasons, writing that it is in his best interest to be kept under lock and key. The Dragonborn discovers that he was arrested for ""airing out his family's dirty laundry."" Specifically, he killed his ex-fiancée's brother after he was confronted about his affairs with other women.
After completing the quest ""Loud and Clear,"" Brynjolf will say that Maven wishes to speak to the Dragonborn.
Maven asks the Dragonborn to find a quill that was lost by Vald.
Louis Letrush tasks the Dragonborn to steal Sibbi's horse, Frost, and give it to him.
I found the Quill of Gemination. ""Really? I wrote that off a long time ago. Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain. Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.""
Maven has a significant amount of unused dialogue, meant to be heard in an attack on Riften as part of the Stormcloak questline. However, this battle never occurs, so the lines are never heard. The first exchange would have occurred upon entering Mistveil Keep in the attack with Galmar Stone-Fist and the other Stormcloak soldiers.[1]
After Maven's surrender, Laila Law-Giver would be initiated the following conversation:[1]

/wiki/Mehrunes_Dagon,"Mehrunes Dagon (in Daedric script: ) is one of the seventeen Daedric Princes of Oblivion and the primary antagonist of An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and the Gates of Oblivion story in The Elder Scrolls Online: Flames of Ambition, Blackwood, Waking Flame, and Deadlands.
Mehrunes Dagon's spheres are destruction, change, revolution, energy, and ambition. Mehrunes Dagon is the foe of all mortal races, and has attempted to conquer the physical world Nirn many times. Some of Mehrunes Dagon's cultists claim that the reason behind his many plots to conquer Nirn is the belief that Tamriel is in fact a plane of Oblivion which is rightly his.[1] This statement however, was not made by Mehrunes Dagon himself, and is thought to be based off of the false assertion that Mundus and Oblivion are not distinct from one another.[2]. Regardless of the reason for his invasions, he invaded Tamriel relentlessly from the First Era onward.
The most famous of Dagon's invasions of Morrowind is certainly the attack on the capital city of Mournhold at the end of the First Era.[3] Dagon was defeated by the god-like Almalexia and Sotha Sil, but not before he destroyed the entire city and devoured its populace. Mehrunes Dagon was also behind the destruction of Ald Sotha, where he destroyed House Sotha. Some time in the early Third Era, Mehrunes Dagon was defeated by the sorcerer Chimere Graegyn. Dagon cursed Chimere by twisting the terms of a pact between the two.[4] During the Imperial Simulacrum, in the years 3E 389-3E 399, Lord Dagon conspired with Uriel Septim VII's powerhungry Battlemage Jagar Tharn to imprison the Emperor in Dagon's plane of Oblivion while Tharn assumed the Emperor's likeness and ruled in his place. Further, Dagon assisted Tharn by attacking the Imperial Battle College in the Battlespire.
This attempt at taking over Tamriel was stopped by a mere mortal. Brooding over his many defeats, Dagon eventually came up with his next attempt to conquer Tamriel. This attempt was to become known as the Oblivion Crisis. He had his Mythic Dawn cultists assassinate the Emperor and all of his heirs, but one was unknown, and survived. The heir, the Blades, and the Hero of Kvatch continually defeated him until the assault on the Imperial City, where Dagon was defeated and banished back to Oblivion by Akatosh himself.[5]
Mehrunes Dagon's plane of Oblivion is the Deadlands. It appears as a collection of collapsed towers with broken bridges on islands surrounded by lava. Pouches of flesh spawn from an unknown source around the Plane, and are capable of holding equipment. It has several towers that were used to house Sigil Stones during the Oblivion Crisis.[6]
Lord Sotha Sil visited Coldharbour, following the destruction of the city of Gilverdale in Valenwood by Molag Bal. He made a deal with eight of the more prominent Daedric Princes: Azura, Boethiah, Hermaeus Mora, Hircine, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath.[7] The terms of the deal were that during the war between Morrowind and Cyrodiil, the Daedric Princes should not accept any summon by a mortal, unless it was done by witches or sorcerers.[7]
However, a former spymaster of Vivec managed to summon Mehrunes Dagon by fueling the rage of a witch of the Skeffington Coven in High Rock. The witch wanted to take revenge upon the Duke of Morrowind, while the spymaster just wanted to see Morrowind suffer after what Vivec had done to him. Mehrunes Dagon went further and destroyed Mournhold, the capital of Morrowind, in one of the most devastating attacks ever recorded by historians. Although Mehrunes Dagon was eventually banished back to Oblivion by a joint effort of Almalexia and Sotha Sil, Mournhold had been totally destroyed, and the Duke of Morrowind was slain.[3] A new city was constructed right atop the ruins of the destroyed Mournhold.
Also in Morrowind, Dagon was responsible for the destruction of Ald Sotha, ancient home of the Dunmer House Sotha and reported birthplace of Sotha Sil. It is also likely here that the Forces of Destruction were somehow involved.
During the Imperial Simulacrum, Jagar Tharn dealt with Mehrunes Dagon, and it is rumored that Molag Bal assisted in some way, although he did not help in the following events.
Mehrunes Dagon as seen in An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire.
After the Miracle of Peace, when the great Numidium was resurrected and destroyed once again, Mehrunes Dagon attempted to invade Tamriel, beginning with the Battlespire, where Imperial Battlemages would undergo their final test before graduating. An unnamed apprentice teleported to the floating fort for his final test, only to find himself in the middle of the Daedric invasion. Through purging the levels and traveling to the Oblivion planes, the apprentice frustrated Mehrunes Dagon's ambitions.
Mehrunes Dagon assaulted the Battlespire, a proving ground and bastion of the Imperial Battlemages. Tharn had to destroy the Imperial Battlemages to solidify his rule over Tamriel in Uriel Septim VII's seat. However, the Prince of Destruction had a hidden agenda: he wanted to invade Tamriel. Since the Prince and his Daedric army could not cross into Tamriel directly, he conquered and used multiple pocket dimensions and the Battlespire, which was the final gateway, as steps to the mortal realm. One of the invaded realms was the Shade Perilous, a realm of the Daedric Prince Nocturnal. Two of Nocturnal's lieutenants, Deyanira Katrece and Jaciel Morgen, suffered severely due to Mehrunes Dagon's invasion.
Although the Battlespire had fallen, an unnamed apprentice managed to banish Mehrunes Dagon to Oblivion. The hero used Mehrunes Dagon's protonymic and neonymic, and then struck the Prince with the Daedric Broadsword of the Moon Reiver, an artifact of great power that was forged from Mehrunes Dagon's own essence. With this action, Mehrunes Dagon's anchor to the mortal realm was severed and he was banished to Oblivion. The Battlespire itself was destroyed in the wake of the invasion, due to the fact that the magicka anchors that supported the floating citadel were also severed.
Another artifact worthy of note in this period of chaos was the Daedric Crescent Blade. These Blades were used in the invasion of the Battlespire by Mehrunes Dagon's army. After the event, the Septim Dynasty declared this weapon illegal, and thus made the blade highly prized among collectors.
In the last years of the Third Era of Tamriel, Mehrunes Dagon formed an alliance with the Altmer wizard Mankar Camoran. Dagon presented Camoran with his book of razors, the Mysterium Xarxes, the principles of which Camoran used to found the Order of the Mythic Dawn, a Daedric cult devoted to the destruction of the Septim bloodline and the re-creation of the Mythic Era in which they believed Dagon would rule.
The most infamous and far-reaching show of power from the Daedric Forces of Destruction occurred during the Oblivion Crisis, where Mehrunes Dagon sought to conquer all of Tamriel. In order for Dagon's Forces to invade, however, the Emperor and his heirs had to be removed. This task fell to the Mythic Dawn, who succeeded in assassinating Emperor Uriel Septim VII. This extinguished the divine Dragonfires and allowed Gates to Oblivion to be opened all across Tamriel. The first attack made by the Daedra was on the city of Kvatch, which was utterly razed. Following the Battle of Kvatch, Oblivion Gates were opened in earnest by the Mythic Dawn, allowing the Daedra to roam the countryside while the main army focused on attacking the major cities.
This invasion was to be foiled by the combined efforts of the last surviving heir to the throne, Martin Septim, and the anonymous Hero of Kvatch. Time and again, the Hero took the battle into Oblivion itself, fighting off the Daedric Forces of Destruction and retrieving the Sigil Stone that anchored the gate to Tamriel, thus closing the portal. After the Hero led the combined forces of Cyrodiil to a famous victory at the city of Bruma, as well as the fall of the Mythic Dawn during the Hero's raid on the cult leader Mankar Camoran's realm of Gaiar Alata, the Daedra launched a final all-out assault on the Imperial City itself.
It was here that Dagon himself entered the battle, in an attempt to stop Martin Septim re-lighting the Dragonfires.[8] But it was to no avail. Using the power within the Amulet of Kings, Martin summoned and merged with Akatosh and banished Dagon back into Oblivion, and with him the whole of the Daedric Forces of Destruction.
This act, however, consumed both Martin himself and the Amulet of Kings, but apparently rendered the Dragonfires and the Septim Bloodline redundant, leaving Tamriel without the need of the institution of the Empire. Presumably, Akatosh's direct intervention, infused with the life-force of a living Septim, secured the wards that kept Oblivion separate from Nirn to the Divine realm rather than the mundane.
In the southern regions of Cyrodiil, deep within a long-forgotten Ayleid ruin, lay the Nefarivigum, a foul construct of Mehrunes Dagon, that was erected to be ever watchful for the pilgrim who would step forth and best an unknown trial of worth.

/wiki/Mehrunes_Dagon,"Mehrunes Dagon (in Daedric script: ) is one of the seventeen Daedric Princes of Oblivion and the primary antagonist of An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and the Gates of Oblivion story in The Elder Scrolls Online: Flames of Ambition, Blackwood, Waking Flame, and Deadlands.
Mehrunes Dagon's spheres are destruction, change, revolution, energy, and ambition. Mehrunes Dagon is the foe of all mortal races, and has attempted to conquer the physical world Nirn many times. Some of Mehrunes Dagon's cultists claim that the reason behind his many plots to conquer Nirn is the belief that Tamriel is in fact a plane of Oblivion which is rightly his.[1] This statement however, was not made by Mehrunes Dagon himself, and is thought to be based off of the false assertion that Mundus and Oblivion are not distinct from one another.[2]. Regardless of the reason for his invasions, he invaded Tamriel relentlessly from the First Era onward.
The most famous of Dagon's invasions of Morrowind is certainly the attack on the capital city of Mournhold at the end of the First Era.[3] Dagon was defeated by the god-like Almalexia and Sotha Sil, but not before he destroyed the entire city and devoured its populace. Mehrunes Dagon was also behind the destruction of Ald Sotha, where he destroyed House Sotha. Some time in the early Third Era, Mehrunes Dagon was defeated by the sorcerer Chimere Graegyn. Dagon cursed Chimere by twisting the terms of a pact between the two.[4] During the Imperial Simulacrum, in the years 3E 389-3E 399, Lord Dagon conspired with Uriel Septim VII's powerhungry Battlemage Jagar Tharn to imprison the Emperor in Dagon's plane of Oblivion while Tharn assumed the Emperor's likeness and ruled in his place. Further, Dagon assisted Tharn by attacking the Imperial Battle College in the Battlespire.
This attempt at taking over Tamriel was stopped by a mere mortal. Brooding over his many defeats, Dagon eventually came up with his next attempt to conquer Tamriel. This attempt was to become known as the Oblivion Crisis. He had his Mythic Dawn cultists assassinate the Emperor and all of his heirs, but one was unknown, and survived. The heir, the Blades, and the Hero of Kvatch continually defeated him until the assault on the Imperial City, where Dagon was defeated and banished back to Oblivion by Akatosh himself.[5]
Mehrunes Dagon's plane of Oblivion is the Deadlands. It appears as a collection of collapsed towers with broken bridges on islands surrounded by lava. Pouches of flesh spawn from an unknown source around the Plane, and are capable of holding equipment. It has several towers that were used to house Sigil Stones during the Oblivion Crisis.[6]
Lord Sotha Sil visited Coldharbour, following the destruction of the city of Gilverdale in Valenwood by Molag Bal. He made a deal with eight of the more prominent Daedric Princes: Azura, Boethiah, Hermaeus Mora, Hircine, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath.[7] The terms of the deal were that during the war between Morrowind and Cyrodiil, the Daedric Princes should not accept any summon by a mortal, unless it was done by witches or sorcerers.[7]
However, a former spymaster of Vivec managed to summon Mehrunes Dagon by fueling the rage of a witch of the Skeffington Coven in High Rock. The witch wanted to take revenge upon the Duke of Morrowind, while the spymaster just wanted to see Morrowind suffer after what Vivec had done to him. Mehrunes Dagon went further and destroyed Mournhold, the capital of Morrowind, in one of the most devastating attacks ever recorded by historians. Although Mehrunes Dagon was eventually banished back to Oblivion by a joint effort of Almalexia and Sotha Sil, Mournhold had been totally destroyed, and the Duke of Morrowind was slain.[3] A new city was constructed right atop the ruins of the destroyed Mournhold.

/wiki/Melaran,"Melaran is an Altmer who serves as the housecarl to Erikur. He can be found either inside Erikur's House or in the Blue Palace.
He is a blunt, outspoken man, with a great respect for Sybille Stentor's magical prowess, although he seems afraid of her. Melaran has a sarcastic side to him.
Should Sybille die, Melaran takes her place as court wizard for Jarl Elisif. He will make a comment on this when asked, and if told he is suited for a position in the court, he will comment on the Dragonborn's involvement in Stentor's demise.
If Melaran is killed, Irnskar Ironhand will send the Dragonborn a letter thanking the Dragonborn for killing him.
Are you the court wizard? ""No. That honor is Sybille Stentor's. A smart man (or ""woman"" if the Dragonborn is female) steers clear of Stentor. And keeps himself (or ""herself"" if the Dragonborn is female) out of the dungeon when she's having a bad day...""
Where can I learn more about magic? ""Oh, I think you'll find that magic is rare in Skyrim. Winterhold, though... The College there has it in abundance. Look there if you wish to learn.""
Are you the court wizard? ""Now that Sybille Stentor is out of the picture, I am indeed. And the court is, well... free of her... eccentricities. Moving into her quarters was an interesting process.""
A place in court seems to suit you. ""It does indeed. You know, I hear you had something to do with Sybille Stentor's demise... That must have been a hard bit of business. I hear Stentor had been alive for a long, long time.""",Melaran,Male Elf Haughty,MaleElfHaughty,High Elf,Male,,108088,78489

When the Dragonborn approaches the cage she is locked in, she asks for help to free her and help her reclaim her Bastion from her sister, Petra. She explains how to avoid traps in the Blind Cliff Bastion and assists with Petra's destruction. After Petra is killed, she will reward the Dragonborn with the Eye of Melka.
Melka can also be killed to obtain the staff, but that will result in the quest remaining unfinished and staying in the unfinished quests list.
After obtaining the Eye of Melka, she can be killed with no negative impact to the rest of the quest, since the quest is already completed.

/wiki/Mena,"Mena is a Breton citizen residing at Enmon's House in the town of Karthwasten. She is the wife of Enmon and the mother of Fjotra. She is typically found within her house during twenty-four hours a day.
When attempting to talk to Mena, she is generally negative and wishes people would leave her and the settlement of Karthwasten alone.
If Enmon tags along in ""The Heart of Dibella"" and dies, she isn't affected at all, despite having both her daughter and husband gone, and goes about her daily routine.
Mena: ""You keep saying that. What if she's gone forever? What if they've done something to her?"" Enmon: ""I don't know. The guards are out looking for her, now. They'll be back soon.""

/wiki/Mercer_Frey,"Mercer Frey is the Breton leader of the Thieves Guild located in Riften and the primary antagonist of the Thieves Guild questline in Skyrim. He is also the owner of Riftweald Manor in Riften, although he is never actually found in or around this location.
Mercer joined the Thieves Guild at some point during the tenure of Guildmaster Gallus Desidenius. Mercer soon began skimming funds from the guild's treasury, which was eventually discovered by Gallus. He took over the position of guild leader after his predecessor Gallus Desidenius was supposedly murdered by Karliah, Mercer's former partner, until the Dragonborn discovered the truth while looking for Karliah with Mercer in tow in the ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.
During the Dragonborn's initiation to the guild, Mercer is usually the one that gives out tasks for them. It is noticeable from the beginning that he always acts impatient and irritated towards the Dragonborn. He shows obvious distaste towards them and becomes increasingly annoyed the more they progress in the Thieves Guild questline. He eventually tries to kill the Dragonborn during ""Speaking With Silence"" and later in ""Blindsighted.""
Mercer Frey is one of the quest characters that can be exploited to follow the Dragonborn throughout Skyrim along with a follower of their choice. In the quest ""Speaking With Silence,"" after they enter Snow Veil Sanctum, they can leave and he will continue to follow them wherever they go.
This is a simple way to obtain a powerful follower as, whilst the mission is still available, he cannot be killed off by the Dragonborn or others. While it is not possible to converse or trade objects with him similar to an ordinary follower, he will remain an unkillable ally; at least until Karliah is found.
Mercer is generally quite pessimistic, stressed, and irritable. Despite his personality, he appears to be quite sly, for example killing the previous leader of the thieves guild, Gallus and blaming it on Karliah, and using her to lure the Dragonborn to Snow Veil Sanctum. He also seems to be adept in swordsmanship, as Karliah states when talking to Mercer, ""Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence, Mercer.""
He seems to be a master of sneak as he was able to silently approach falmer and assassinate them swiftly while also sneaking past many of their chaurus. This could possibly be the result of Mercer unlocking his hidden potential with the Skeleton Key. His lockpicking skill is debatable: he is seen picking locks that are unpickable, but this is almost certainly because he uses the Skeleton Key, which was in his possession at the time. It is also possible that he has generally good knowledge of the locks themselves.
As the true extent of his actions is revealed, Mercer is shown to be a man utterly lacking in scruples both personal and moral, willing to betray and murder anyone who trusts him for personal profit. Over the course of more than twenty-five years, Mercer broke his sworn oath to Nocturnal and stole the Skeleton Key, robbed the Thieves Guild blind, murdered his predecessor and pinned the blame on Karliah.
Mercer will assign the Dragonborn the first job in the Thieves Guild, which requires the Dragonborn to go to the Goldenglow Estate to teach the proprietor a lesson. Before going there, the Dragonborn can optionally talk to Vex in order to discover the location of the secret entrance to the estate.
Maven Black-Briar tasks the Dragonborn to shut down a competitor, newly opened Honningbrew Meadery, and to find out how its owner Sabjorn has managed so quickly to fund its opening.
After following Mercer inside the Snow Veil Sanctum, all the way to the word wall, he will attempt to end the Dragonborn's life. However, Karliah saves them and nurses them back to life and will then reveal Mercer's treachery to the guild.
The Dragonborn travels to Irkngthand, a vast dwarven ruin that supposedly contains the legendary ""Eyes of the Falmer."" Karliah and Brynjolf are waiting for them within. Together they hope to stop Mercer Frey from stealing the Eyes and escaping from Skyrim with the Skeleton Key of Nocturnal.",Mercer Frey,Male Sly Cynical,MaleSlyCynical,Breton,Male,,140881,110716
/wiki/Meridia,"The Daedric Prince of Life and Lady of Infinite Energies, Meridia (in Daedric script, ), once known as Merid-Nunda,[1] is one of the Princes whose obscurity renders her incomprehensible to most mortals, but is associated with the energy of living things.[2] The invocation for Meridia is 13th of Morning Star.[source?] Meridia can also be summoned at her shrine, if the summoner offers something from the corpse of an undead creature at the statue. Meridia's holdings in Oblivion are collectively known as the ""Colored Rooms.""[1]
Meridia, as summoned in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.
She almost always comes in the form of a beautiful woman. Meridia has always had a hatred for all things undead. She takes great joy in rewarding mortals who purge the realms of the wretched walking-corpses, along with any necromancers who have tampered with Meridia's life-giving energies. Meridia is one of the few Daedric Princes considered to be benevolent by mortals. This is attributable to her originally being a Magne-Ge, thus her interests are aligned with what would become the mortal races enough to (at least initially) agree to help create Nirn.
During the Dawn Era, Meridia was known as Merid-Nunda, an Et'Adaconfirmation needed. After Lorkhan's true intentions were discovered, Merid-Nunda fled Mundus along with Magnus and became one of the Magna Ge. After consorting with Daedra, Merid-Nunda was cast down, and in turn became the Daedric Prince Meridia.[1][UL 1] According to Khajiit mythology, Merid-Nunda is the daughter of Magrus, the Khajiiti equivalent of Magnus, but he didn't love her as he only loved his own creations. She was supposedly created out of aether.[3]
In the First Era, during Alessia's rebellion, the Ayleids made a pact with Meridia and her minions the Aurorans, to help the Ayleids against the human rebellion.[4] The Ayleids' champion, Umaril the Unfeathered, bound his life force in the realm of Meridia. This made him have Daedra-like immortality. When he is slain in the Mundus, his spirit will float in the Water of Oblivion and eventually return to Meridia's realm.[5]
Sometime in 3E 433, Meridia was summoned by the Champion of Cyrodiil. Meridia solicited the champion to cleanse a certain cave of Necromancers and their undead. She rewarded the champion with her Ring of Khajiiti.[6] The same artifact was given by Meridia to the Hero of Daggerfall 28 years earlier after they killed a sorcerer for her.[7]
Some two hundred years later, in the midst of the Stormcloak Rebellion, the necromancer Malkoran broke into a temple to Meridia situated near Mount Kilkreath in Skyrim, and proceeded to perform experiments on the casualties of the civil war, Stormcloak and Imperial alike. Meridia, infuriated, commissioned the Last Dragonborn with destroying Malkoran and his creations. Upon the necromancer's death, Meridia presented the Dragonborn with the legendary sword Dawnbreaker.[8]
The Ring of Khajiit is an ancient relic, and was stolen by a thief named Rajhin, who made it famous. He used the powers of the ring to make himself invisible and move quickly. With it, he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyr. His fate became a mystery, though it is said that the Ring betrayed him to his enemies.

Mirabelle is not close to a lot of people other than Savos Aren, the Arch-Mage, but she is respected for the most part by her fellow College members. She is a stern woman and spends most of her time reading in the courtyard.
When Faralda lets the Dragonborn across the bridge, they will meet Mirabelle, where she is in conversation with Ancano, a Thalmor operative sent to serve as an advisor to the Arch-Mage. After their discussion is over, she can be talked to receive a Novice Hood and Novice Robes of Destruction and a tour of the exterior of the College.
When asked about the Staff of Magnus, she replies that the Synod was at the College recently, looking for magical artifacts, and were under the impression ""that we had it in a closet somewhere,"" and she tells the Dragonborn that the Synod went to Mzulft, if they want to look for them.
After Ancano kills Savos Aren, Mirabelle sends the Dragonborn out to look for him, as well as destroy the magic anomalies that have infested Winterhold.
Following ""Containment,"" and reporting to her that the Staff of Magnus is in Labyrinthian, Mirabelle will give the Dragonborn the door knocker needed to enter Labyrinthian, as well as Savos' amulet.
When the Dragonborn returns from Labyrinthian with the Staff in hand, they can ask where Mirabelle is, and Tolfdir will reply that she sacrificed herself to get the others to safety, and out of Ancano's reach. Afterward, Tolfdir replaces Mirabelle as Master Wizard.
You said something about a tour? ""Yes, just a brief overview of our facilities. Are you ready?""
Mirabelle ""I believe I made myself rather clear."" Ancano ""Yes, of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind the decision."" Mirabelle ""You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but you will find the Thalmor will find no such treatment here. You are here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage. I hope you appreciate the opportunity."" Mirabelle ""Very good. Then we're done here.""",Mirabelle Ervine,Mirabelle  Ervine,FemaleUniqueMirabelleErvine,Breton,Female,,115129,115104
/wiki/Mirmulnir,"Mirmulnir (Dragon Language: ) is a dragon that attacks the Western Watchtower outside of Whiterun. He is a supporting antagonist of the main storyline and the first dragon in the main questline slain by a prisoner who escaped from Helgen, helping them discover their identity as the Last Dragonborn.
It can be read in a book in Sky Haven Temple that Mirmulnir was among one of the very few dragons that were not killed by the Blades. He was last seen in the Reach in 2E 212,[1] and does not reappear until 4E 201.
Upon learning of this threat, Jarl Balgruuf the Greater sends his Housecarl Irileth, the Dragonborn, and several Whiterun Guards. Once the party is assembled there, the dragon attack begins. Mirmulnir's primary weapons are his razor-sharp teeth and his powerful Fire Breath shout. When the Dragonborn slays him, they absorb his soul before everybody's eyes.",Mirmulnir,,,,,Dragon,370378,117253
/wiki/Mithorpa_Nasyal,"Mithorpa Nasyal is a Dunmer in Skyrim who was originally intended to reside at Barleydark Farm.

/wiki/Mjoll_the_Lioness,"Mjoll the Lioness is a Nord warrior. She has traveled Tamriel extensively and claims to be as experienced and well traveled as one can be. She and Aerin may be found in the Bee and Barb inn, wandering around Riften, or in Aerin's House at night.
Mjoll is a kind person with good intentions, but can come off as a little intimidating. She gains the most pleasure simply by doing the right thing and earning people's trust rather than by earning any material reward. She strongly dislikes the Thieves Guild and the Black-Briar family, as she feels they contribute to a large part of Riften's corruption. 
When I was a child, my village was burned to the ground by bandits. Do you know I actually saw one laugh as he ran my brother through... my father wanted me to follow in his footsteps as a hunter, but I set my aspirations a bit higher. He never complained... I miss him. I've never been a sellsword... never traded my skills for pay. I've always adventured on my own terms.
When speaking about her past, Mjoll mentions that her mother taught her how to use a sword, and that her father was a hunter. She grew up in a village that was at one point burned to the ground by bandits, and her brother was killed during the raid; it is because of this that she harbors much resentment towards bandits.[1]
She and her parents were very close, her mother often taking her to Solitude to gaze at the ships at the docks. She and her father occasionally journeyed east to Morrowind on hunting expeditions, cliff racers being among the things they stalked. Her father wanted her to become a hunter as well, however her life took a different path when she became an adventurer.[1]
In one of her most recent endeavors, she was nearly killed by a Dwarven Centurion in the ruins of Mzinchaleft. It was only by her skill and persistence that she was able to escape. Barely alive, she was saved by Aerin, who then brought her back to his home in Riften and nursed her back to health. While she recovered, Aerin revealed to her the corruption that plagued Riften. To return the favor, she has sworn to do whatever it takes to rid Riften of criminals and misers. To her disappointment, progress in that regard is slow. In her words, ""the city has to want to save itself before [she] can save it.""[1]
When the Dragonborn first meets her in Riften, she speaks about losing her sword, Grimsever. The Dragonborn may offer to retrieve it for her; if this objective is completed, Mjoll becomes a potential spouse. She can also be recruited as a follower, and if Hearthfire is installed, can be made a steward at one of the Dragonborn's properties.
To receive Mjoll's quest, the Dragonborn must be at least level 14 and Mjoll must like them. The easiest way to gain her favor is to simply agree with her in that the Thieves Guild in Riften is evil. Alternatively, Mjoll's favor can be gained by performing favors for the citizens of Riften. You must level up once after gaining her favor to receive the quest.
If the Dragonborn marries her with an Amulet of Mara, beyond the quest's completion, she has the option of moving in with her spouse. Regardless of the home chosen, she opens a shop where goods can be sold and purchased. She will share daily profits with the Dragonborn, which start at 100  and increase by 100  daily. Uncollected profits stack and can be collected at any time. Mjoll's default residence is Aerin's House. She continues to live there unless instructed otherwise. Should she move with her spouse to another house, Aerin follows her.
Mjoll may be recruited into the Blades, although Aerin will follow her to Sky Haven Temple. When she is engaging in a battle with a dragon alongside the Blades, Aerin follows and attempts to slay the dragon with his dagger. This usually results in his death. If Mjoll is married to the Dragonborn when recruited into the Blades, she can be told to go back to their designated home; she will say that she is going back to Riften but will actually go to Sky Haven Temple.
By default, Mjoll uses a Hunting Bow and leveled battleaxe to fight. If Mjoll is given magic staves, she will use them as her preferred weapons for striking at a distance. She can double-wield staves and is very quick and accurate both against targets on the ground and against flying dragons. However, she cannot recharge the staves herself; the Dragonborn must take them back, recharge them, and give them back to her.
Her default armor is banded iron armor, with iron gauntlets and iron boots.",Mjoll the Lioness,Female Nord,FemaleNord,Nord,Female,,105975,78699

Upon talking to Ysolda as part of the quest, the Dragonborn will find out that a marriage proposal was made to a woman they met while intoxicated. After seeking the woman out, Moira turns out to be a Hagraven, and says that she is waiting to consummate the promised marriage. When asked to return the wedding ring, she becomes hostile, claiming that the Dragonborn wishes to give the ring to ""that hussy Esmerelda with the dark feathers,"" adding that she will not let Esmerelda have them. Backing out of conversation with Moira will also lead to her mentioning Esmerelda and becoming hostile.",Moira,,,,,Hagraven,117560,117555
/wiki/Molag_Bal,"Molag Bal (Daedric:  ""Stone-Fire"")[1] is the God of Schemes[2] and the Daedric Prince of domination and enslavement of mortals. He is also known by the titles King of Rape,[2] King of Strife,[UL 1] Schemer Prince, Harvester of Souls,[3] Father of Coldharbour and Lord of Lies.[4] He is the creator of Vampires and Xivkyn as well.[5]
His main desire is to harvest and consume the souls of mortals and to bring mortals' souls under his sway by spreading seeds of strife and discord in the mortal realms, and has even attempted to merge Nirn with his own freezing realm of Coldharbour.[6] He holds much importance in Morrowind where he is one of the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, seen as the arch-enemy of Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of Plots. He is the primary antagonist of The Elder Scrolls Online.
Molag Bal resembles a large, bipedal hybrid of a bull and a reptile, and usually appears in a form adorned with horns, fangs, claws and a long tail. His scaly appearance is matched by his demeanor: Molag Bal is the master of corruption, and his freezing realm of Coldharbour in Oblivion is a twisted reflection of Nirn, consisting of nothing but desolation and suffering.[6]
Like all the Daedric Princes, Molag Bal has no definite gender. Most often, however, he appears to his followers as male. Sigillah Parate mentions in her spiritual commentary that she belonged to a cult known as the ""Witches of Molag Bal,"" where Molag Bal often appeared to its members in the guise of a mortal female.[7]
A shrine of Molag Bal is in Markarth, in a tunnel underneath the Abandoned House. For a Daedric shrine, it is extremely small, consisting only of a sort of stone basin decorated with a stylized head of Molag Bal. A panel on the floor in front of it can extend spikes in order to trap sacrificial victims. The Rusty Mace — in reality the Mace of Molag Bal — is found here by the Dragonborn. If Dawnguard is installed there will be a shrine inside Castle Volkihar.
Molag Bal's plane of Oblivion is Coldharbour. The book The Doors of Oblivion says that his plane resembles a copy of Nirn, including the Imperial Palace, but desecrated and ruined. The ground is sludge, the sky is on fire, and the air is freezing.
Coldharbour is featured in The Elder Scrolls Online, being the final region of the main questline leading up to the assault on Molag Bal.
Molag Bal is the main source of the obstacles faced by the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Great Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity,' befitting his title as the King of Rape. He is said to have seduced Vivec and fathered a population of monsters that ran amok across Morrowind, that Vivec later had to slay to extinction[8][9]. This race may have been the first vampires[10], a corruption of Vivec's ties to the Heart of Lorkhan transmitted to mortals. It is possible he assisted Jagar Tharn in his temporary ascendance to the Imperial throne[source?]. He was also responsible for the destruction of a city, Gilverdale, at the end of the First Era.
In 1E 2920, Molag Bal, under the summon of King Dro'Zel of Senchal, destroyed the city of Gilverdale. All the inhabitants were killed in a bright red mist. This Daedric massacre forced Sotha Sil to make a journey to Coldharbour, dealing with some of the prominent Daedric Princes in order to avoid the fate of Gilverdale happening to other cities in Tamriel, as Morrowind was still fighting a war against Cyrodiil.[source?]
Molag Bal appears as the main antagonist in The Elder Scrolls Online. He takes advantage of the destruction and war going on in Tamriel and attempts to merge Nirn and Coldharbour into one nightmarish hellscape by using Daedric machines called Dark Anchors, in an event known as the Planemeld.[11]
The Soulless One, also known as Vestige, along with Vanus Galerion, the Fighters Guild, and the Mages Guild lead an attack on Coldharbour to confront Molag Bal and put an end to his treachery. A city controlled by Meridia was transported into Coldharbour by Meridia herself, and since Molag Bal had no power over it, the Soulless One and the attack force were able to use the city as a safe haven while in Coldharbour and save many mortals who were ""stuck"" in Coldharbour.[12] With the help of the Ayleid king Laloriaran Dynar, Vanus Galerion the Altmeri founder of the Mages Guild, they pushed further into Coldharbour's citadel to Molag Bal's lair. Later on, the Groundskeeper revealed her true nature as the Daedric Prince Meridia and the Soulless One and Five Companions went through a portal to an area that was under complete domination of Molag Bal's forces. Meridia and Molag Bal met face to face and began dueling, allowing the Soulless One to proceed to destroy the Dark Anchors. Upon confrontation the Soulless One used the Amulet of Kings on the Daedric Prince before they could be defeated. The two began to battle, both equal in power with divinity, but in the end, Molag Bal fell for the first time and was ""dominated"" by the Soulless One, allowing every Soul Shriven enslaved by Molag Bal to return to Nirn. 
Molag Bal's avatar as seen in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.
The Hero of Daggerfall received the Mace of Molag Bal in exchange for eliminating a heretic mage or priest, respectively.
Molag Bal was summoned by the Hero. He wanted the Champion to corrupt Melus Petilius by forcing him to kill with the Cursed Mace. The Champion was able to enrage Petilius causing him to grab the Cursed Mace and use it to kill the Champion. Right before the final blow, Molag Bal transported the Champion back to his shrine and, pleased with a job well done, gave him the Mace of Molag Bal.
During the Fourth Era, the Dragonborn helped a Vigilant of Stendarr named Tyranus to investigate suspicious activity at an abandoned house in Markarth. After arriving in the house, Molag Bal forced them to fight each other resulting in Tyranus's death. Upon speaking with the Daedric Prince, he promised the Dragonborn his mace if they returned Logrolf the Willful, a priest of Boethiah to the abandoned house and made him pledge his soul to Molag Bal. The Dragonborn then killed the priest with Molag Bal's mace on his altar.
The Dunmeri Temple's doctrine, Vampires of Vvardenfell, v II, states that the Daedric Prince Molag Bal is the father of vampires. It is recorded in his ""Private Papers of Galur Rithari, Buoyant Armiger."" Somehow, the Dunmeri Temple keeps this record from the world, for no clear reason.
Molag Bal as the father of Vampirism is also recorded in the book called ""Opusculus Lamae Bal ta Mezzamortie."" The book tells a story of Molag Bal, who, in his hatred towards Arkay, profaned the body of a virgin Nedic woman, Lamae Beolfag. Lamae was killed by the ordeal, but rose from the dead as Lamae Bal, as well as the Blood Matron and the First Vampire.
Pure-blooded vampires are those who were granted vampirism directly from Molag Bal, the creator and patron deity of Vampires. The process is somewhat similar to the creation of the first vampire, Lamae Beolfag—mortals gain their vampirism through a ritual in which members of a family pledge themselves to Molag Bal. Women who survive the horrific ordeal, such as Serana and her mother Valerica, are dubbed ""Daughters of Coldharbour.""
Galur Rithari, one of the Buoyant Armigers, was cured of vampirism by Molag Bal.
The Vampires of Iliac Bay and Vvardenfell are easily recognized by the average person, but this is not entirely true for Cyrodilic vampires—obviously due to different blood. The Cyrodilic vampires have three states of vampire form, dependent on the time since feeding.

/wiki/Molag_Bal,"Molag Bal (Daedric:  ""Stone-Fire"")[1] is the God of Schemes[2] and the Daedric Prince of domination and enslavement of mortals. He is also known by the titles King of Rape,[2] King of Strife,[UL 1] Schemer Prince, Harvester of Souls,[3] Father of Coldharbour and Lord of Lies.[4] He is the creator of Vampires and Xivkyn as well.[5]
His main desire is to harvest and consume the souls of mortals and to bring mortals' souls under his sway by spreading seeds of strife and discord in the mortal realms, and has even attempted to merge Nirn with his own freezing realm of Coldharbour.[6] He holds much importance in Morrowind where he is one of the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, seen as the arch-enemy of Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of Plots. He is the primary antagonist of The Elder Scrolls Online.
Molag Bal resembles a large, bipedal hybrid of a bull and a reptile, and usually appears in a form adorned with horns, fangs, claws and a long tail. His scaly appearance is matched by his demeanor: Molag Bal is the master of corruption, and his freezing realm of Coldharbour in Oblivion is a twisted reflection of Nirn, consisting of nothing but desolation and suffering.[6]
Like all the Daedric Princes, Molag Bal has no definite gender. Most often, however, he appears to his followers as male. Sigillah Parate mentions in her spiritual commentary that she belonged to a cult known as the ""Witches of Molag Bal,"" where Molag Bal often appeared to its members in the guise of a mortal female.[7]
A shrine of Molag Bal is in Markarth, in a tunnel underneath the Abandoned House. For a Daedric shrine, it is extremely small, consisting only of a sort of stone basin decorated with a stylized head of Molag Bal. A panel on the floor in front of it can extend spikes in order to trap sacrificial victims. The Rusty Mace — in reality the Mace of Molag Bal — is found here by the Dragonborn. If Dawnguard is installed there will be a shrine inside Castle Volkihar.
Molag Bal's plane of Oblivion is Coldharbour. The book The Doors of Oblivion says that his plane resembles a copy of Nirn, including the Imperial Palace, but desecrated and ruined. The ground is sludge, the sky is on fire, and the air is freezing.
Coldharbour is featured in The Elder Scrolls Online, being the final region of the main questline leading up to the assault on Molag Bal.
Molag Bal is the main source of the obstacles faced by the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Great Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity,' befitting his title as the King of Rape. He is said to have seduced Vivec and fathered a population of monsters that ran amok across Morrowind, that Vivec later had to slay to extinction[8][9]. This race may have been the first vampires[10], a corruption of Vivec's ties to the Heart of Lorkhan transmitted to mortals. It is possible he assisted Jagar Tharn in his temporary ascendance to the Imperial throne[source?]. He was also responsible for the destruction of a city, Gilverdale, at the end of the First Era.
In 1E 2920, Molag Bal, under the summon of King Dro'Zel of Senchal, destroyed the city of Gilverdale. All the inhabitants were killed in a bright red mist. This Daedric massacre forced Sotha Sil to make a journey to Coldharbour, dealing with some of the prominent Daedric Princes in order to avoid the fate of Gilverdale happening to other cities in Tamriel, as Morrowind was still fighting a war against Cyrodiil.[source?]
Molag Bal appears as the main antagonist in The Elder Scrolls Online. He takes advantage of the destruction and war going on in Tamriel and attempts to merge Nirn and Coldharbour into one nightmarish hellscape by using Daedric machines called Dark Anchors, in an event known as the Planemeld.[11]
The Soulless One, also known as Vestige, along with Vanus Galerion, the Fighters Guild, and the Mages Guild lead an attack on Coldharbour to confront Molag Bal and put an end to his treachery. A city controlled by Meridia was transported into Coldharbour by Meridia herself, and since Molag Bal had no power over it, the Soulless One and the attack force were able to use the city as a safe haven while in Coldharbour and save many mortals who were ""stuck"" in Coldharbour.[12] With the help of the Ayleid king Laloriaran Dynar, Vanus Galerion the Altmeri founder of the Mages Guild, they pushed further into Coldharbour's citadel to Molag Bal's lair. Later on, the Groundskeeper revealed her true nature as the Daedric Prince Meridia and the Soulless One and Five Companions went through a portal to an area that was under complete domination of Molag Bal's forces. Meridia and Molag Bal met face to face and began dueling, allowing the Soulless One to proceed to destroy the Dark Anchors. Upon confrontation the Soulless One used the Amulet of Kings on the Daedric Prince before they could be defeated. The two began to battle, both equal in power with divinity, but in the end, Molag Bal fell for the first time and was ""dominated"" by the Soulless One, allowing every Soul Shriven enslaved by Molag Bal to return to Nirn. 
Molag Bal's avatar as seen in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.
The Hero of Daggerfall received the Mace of Molag Bal in exchange for eliminating a heretic mage or priest, respectively.
Molag Bal was summoned by the Hero. He wanted the Champion to corrupt Melus Petilius by forcing him to kill with the Cursed Mace. The Champion was able to enrage Petilius causing him to grab the Cursed Mace and use it to kill the Champion. Right before the final blow, Molag Bal transported the Champion back to his shrine and, pleased with a job well done, gave him the Mace of Molag Bal.
During the Fourth Era, the Dragonborn helped a Vigilant of Stendarr named Tyranus to investigate suspicious activity at an abandoned house in Markarth. After arriving in the house, Molag Bal forced them to fight each other resulting in Tyranus's death. Upon speaking with the Daedric Prince, he promised the Dragonborn his mace if they returned Logrolf the Willful, a priest of Boethiah to the abandoned house and made him pledge his soul to Molag Bal. The Dragonborn then killed the priest with Molag Bal's mace on his altar.
The Dunmeri Temple's doctrine, Vampires of Vvardenfell, v II, states that the Daedric Prince Molag Bal is the father of vampires. It is recorded in his ""Private Papers of Galur Rithari, Buoyant Armiger."" Somehow, the Dunmeri Temple keeps this record from the world, for no clear reason.
Molag Bal as the father of Vampirism is also recorded in the book called ""Opusculus Lamae Bal ta Mezzamortie."" The book tells a story of Molag Bal, who, in his hatred towards Arkay, profaned the body of a virgin Nedic woman, Lamae Beolfag. Lamae was killed by the ordeal, but rose from the dead as Lamae Bal, as well as the Blood Matron and the First Vampire.
Pure-blooded vampires are those who were granted vampirism directly from Molag Bal, the creator and patron deity of Vampires. The process is somewhat similar to the creation of the first vampire, Lamae Beolfag—mortals gain their vampirism through a ritual in which members of a family pledge themselves to Molag Bal. Women who survive the horrific ordeal, such as Serana and her mother Valerica, are dubbed ""Daughters of Coldharbour.""

Formerly, Movarth was a Hand-to-Hand trainer in the Fighters Guild, as detailed by the book Immortal Blood. By the time of his vampiric infection, Movarth was an accomplished vampire hunter. He had killed vampires in the Volkihar Clan, as well as those of the Keerilth of Valenwood.
While recovering there, Movarth inquired about the types of vampires around Tamriel. The priest in the chapel told him about the different vampire tribes. Thenceforward, he pledged to destroy each tribe, bringing back any vampire-hunting knowledge he acquired in his quest for the priest. His quest was cut short when the priest revealed his vampiric nature and attacked Movarth, turning him into a vampire.[1]
By the Fourth Era, Movarth settled in Skyrim and attempted to mastermind a hostile take over of Morthal. His intention was to use a local Nord woman named Alva to seduce the guards and turn them one by one into thralls. Following this, he planned to wrangle up the townsfolk and exploit them as cattle.

To keep his identity cloaked, he is referred to as ""an elven mage who studies the stars."" This nods to his involvement with Malyn Varen's unlawful research into Soul Gems and Azura's Star.
After finding the Shrine of Azura and speaking with Aranea Ienith, the sole priestess found there, the Dragonborn can either go to the Inn directly and ask Nelacar about his involvement with the artifact, or ask Faralda at the College of Winterhold if she has heard of the ""elven mage who studies the stars."" Slightly shocked that the Dragonborn came to this knowledge, she directs them to the The Frozen Hearth where an Altmer named Nelacar is encountered. Requiring a bit of persuasion, intimidation, or gold, Nelacar reveals that a Dunmer necromancer by the name of Malyn Varen stole Azura's Star from the Daedric Prince and retreated to Ilinalta's Deep, where he sought to achieve a measure of immortality by trapping his soul within the contraption.
After recovering the star, he can transform the Broken Azura's Star into The Black Star, an unlimited Black Soul Gem. From this point on, Nelacar becomes a spell tomes merchant. If the Dragonborn brings Azura’s Star to Aranea, however, Nelacar stops offering merchant services and instead berates them for serving Azura if spoken to.

Nepos, alongside with Thonar Silver-Blood, is the primary antagonist of the quest. He is located in his house and is found reading a book by the fire. His servants, Tynan, Morven, and Uaile appear to be very caring and protective of him, but are actually Forsworn Agents, tasked with watching over him. Uaile greets the Dragonborn at the entrance, and tells them Nepos is busy and should not be disturbed. Nepos' dialogue reveals that he is a Forsworn who answers to Madanach, the King in Rags. He further tells of how Madanach works from the Cidhna Mine, a Nordic prison, directing the downtrodden citizens to kill in the name of the Forsworn. He appears to be unaware of the deal Madanach struck with the Silver-Bloods and believes he is furthering the Forsworn cause. After exiting the dialogue with Nepos, the Dragonborn will be attacked by Nepos, Uaile, Tynan and Morven.

/wiki/Nocturnal,"Nocturnal (in Daedric script, ) is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the night and darkness. She is also known as the Night Mistress[1] and Lady Luck.[2] The Cyrodiilic Thieves Guild leader, the Gray Fox, has the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal, which truly represents the sphere's darkness quality; it permanently removes the wearer's specific identity from all history. Regardless, the Cyrodiilic Thieves Guild venerates Nocturnal by ending talks with the saying ""Shadow hide you."" The summoning date of Nocturnal is 3rd of Hearthfire.[3]
Nocturnal and Azura have been referred to as sisters, though whether in the literal or the metaphorical sense is unknown.[3] Nocturnal is sometimes referred to as Ur-Dra,[4][note 1] referencing her claim as part of the original Void[5][6] She is thought to be the ""eldest and most powerful of the Daedric Princes.""[1] The Khajiit know her as Noctra, who can bring shadows and luck when called upon.[7]
Nocturnal, as she appears in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.
Physical descriptions of Nocturnal are difficult to come by, as she is usually described as being hidden by darkness and shadow. Depictions of the Daedric Prince usually take the form of a nondescript human woman, draped in a hooded cloak that hides most of her features and body. She is depicted with both arms outstretched, and a pair of Nightingales (or similar bird) perched on each wrist.
Nocturnal claims to be an aspect of the void of Oblivion itself, and takes such titles as Mother of Night or Night Mistress. Her very nature is such that humans cannot understand her, as she is the embodiment of the unfathomable and enigmatic. Worshipers of Nocturnal consist primarily of those who operate in darkness and night, such as thieves and spies. However, Nocturnal's deception is not usually meant to be harmful or violent in the manner of Boethiah. Rather, the unknowable nature of Nocturnal is the core of her being, and serves no real ulterior purposes beyond being mysterious. Thus, while thieves may consider Nocturnal their patron, assassins will typically lean towards a more violent deity, such as Molag Bal or Mephala.
Of Nocturnal, Karliah says she is, ""like a scolding mother who pushes her child to do better,"" meaning she appears to care about mortals, unlike some other Daedric Princes.
Although Nocturnal has arguably one of the largest followings of all the Daedric Princes, she has no form of organized clergy. There are a few who call themselves priests of Nocturnal, though the Night Mistress does not herself seem to show them any particular favor. Indeed, Nocturnal seems to have no real interest in worship. A temple of Nocturnal does exist called the Twilight Sepulcher, located in Skyrim, though this was built around the portal known as the Ebonmere, the portal to Nocturnal's plane of Oblivion known as Evergloam. Supposedly, Nocturnal is the source of a thief's luck, which flows from the Ebonmere and plays a heavy role in the lives of any who use the shadows to do their work, though none know what price is paid in return.
Though Nocturnal has no truly organized clergy, she has three mortal servants upon Nirn who are known as the Nightingales. The Nightingales serve Nocturnal directly, granted the power over shadow, subterfuge and strife in exchange for their service. Once a Nightingale enters into their contract with Nocturnal, they are bound for life and beyond to serve the Night Mistress in guarding the Twilight Sepulcher and in Nocturnal's realm Evergloam until Nocturnal feels the Nightingale's contract with her has been fulfilled.
Like most Daedric Princes, Nocturnal has female, magic-using worshipers known as witches. In Purloined Shadows, a coven dedicated to Nocturnal is seen worshipping her. Nocturnal seems to enjoy the praise they give her, smiling as they sang of her great mystery.
Nocturnal has at least one cult dedicated to her, the Whispering Shadows. They operated throughout the Clockwork City in the Second Era. In Summerset she has only one known human follower, known as Earl Tundilwen.
The Bow of Shadows was forged by Nocturnal and granted to the ranger Raerlas Ghile for a sacred mission during which, scores of Raerlas' foes were taken down by him, with the aid of the bow. The mission ultimately failed and the Bow was lost. The Bow was also used by the Dunmer assassin Dram during the Second Era. The Bow of Shadows grants its wielder increased speed and invisibility.[8]
The Eye of Nocturnal is an artifact through which Nocturnal can see into the world of Nirn.[9] The Eye was stolen from Nocturnal during the Oblivion Crisis, and was later retrieved by her champion.[10]
The most famous feature of Nocturnal is the enchanted cowl she created. This headpiece possessed the ability to completely hide its wearer's identity from mortal knowledge, including magical forms of scrying and identification. The cowl's power was so great that people would be incapable of even remembering the name of whomever possessed the cowl, even while the cowl was not being worn. No one would be able to retain any long term memory of interacting with the cowl's wearer, and even removing the cowl in plain sight of others would not break its spell.
The cowl was reportedly stolen by the head of the Thieves Guild (Emer Dareloth) during the Third Era, promptly removing any memory of the person in question from history. Henceforth, according to legend, the bearer of the cowl was known only as ""Gray Fox,"" though it was not commonly known that the cowl was responsible for his infamy.
The cowl was also told stolen in a song called ""Song of Hrormir."" Nocturnal was tricked by Hrormir in order to save his old companion Darfang. She traded Darfang's soul for the service (by keeping his soul) of Hrormir, so that he would assist her followers dividing the kingdom of Aelfendor, but in the end the kingdom was left intact while Nocturnal's followers were divided. And the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal was also taken by Hrormir. To get the cowl back, Nocturnal was forced to release Hrormir's soul and left with nothing to gain.
The Skeleton Key was reportedly owned by a mortal for the first time by an obscured person named Arrovan. Many years later, the Eternal Champion during the Imperial Simulacrum found a map in a dungeon in Valenwood that pointed to the location of the Skeleton Key somewhere in Summerset Isle. Using the map, the Eternal Champion found and claimed the key. Then sometime in 3E 397, the Hero of Azra's Crossing found the Skeleton Key in one of the chests in the Citadel of Broken Wing. Indeed, the artifact travels between heroes and locations, as the legend says, it would never be the property of one thief for too long.
In Skyrim, the Skeleton Key was given a new level of importance and power. In the Thieves Guild story-line, the Dragonborn discovers that not only can the Key unlock physical barriers, but also metaphysical ones. As demonstrated by Mercer Frey in the ""Blindsighted"" quest, the Skeleton Key also unlocks human potential.
Frey's theft of the Skeleton Key from the Twilight Sepulcher's Inner Sanctum in the Fourth Era is said to be the reason for the hard times that have fallen on the Guild in Skyrim, since the Ebonmere, the gate to Nocturnal's plane of Oblivion, was kept open by the Skeleton Key, allowing luck to grace the actions of thieves throughout Nirn. It also allows the owner to pick any lock without the Skeleton Key breaking.
In Clockwork City, Nocturnal attempts to steal the Skeleton Key from Sotha Sil in order to take over the Clockwork City, hoping to potentially remake reality. She is stopped and cast out. Sotha Sil gives the key to Divayth Fyr for safekeeping.
For the reasons aforementioned the Skeleton Key might very well be the most powerful, if underestimated, Daedric artifact known. The ability to overcome any obstacle regardless of it being physical or otherwise by its user. Plainly seen as it has no trouble opening a doorway to a plane of Oblivion.",Nocturnal,Female Dark Elf,FemaleDarkElf,Redguard,Female,,107243,107215

A temple of Nocturnal does exist called the Twilight Sepulcher, located in Skyrim, though this was built around the portal known as the Ebonmere, the portal to Nocturnal's plane of Oblivion known as Evergloam. Supposedly, Nocturnal is the source of a thief's luck, which flows from the Ebonmere and plays a heavy role in the lives of any who use the shadows to do their work, though none know what price is paid in return.
Though Nocturnal has no truly organized clergy, she has three mortal servants upon Nirn who are known as the Nightingales. The Nightingales serve Nocturnal directly, granted the power over shadow, subterfuge and strife in exchange for their service. Once a Nightingale enters into their contract with Nocturnal, they are bound for life and beyond to serve the Night Mistress in guarding the Twilight Sepulcher and in Nocturnal's realm Evergloam until Nocturnal feels the Nightingale's contract with her has been fulfilled.
Like most Daedric Princes, Nocturnal has female, magic-using worshipers known as witches. In Purloined Shadows, a coven dedicated to Nocturnal is seen worshipping her. Nocturnal seems to enjoy the praise they give her, smiling as they sang of her great mystery.
Nocturnal has at least one cult dedicated to her, the Whispering Shadows. They operated throughout the Clockwork City in the Second Era. In Summerset she has only one known human follower, known as Earl Tundilwen.
The Bow of Shadows was forged by Nocturnal and granted to the ranger Raerlas Ghile for a sacred mission during which, scores of Raerlas' foes were taken down by him, with the aid of the bow. The mission ultimately failed and the Bow was lost. The Bow was also used by the Dunmer assassin Dram during the Second Era. The Bow of Shadows grants its wielder increased speed and invisibility.[8]
The Eye of Nocturnal is an artifact through which Nocturnal can see into the world of Nirn.[9] The Eye was stolen from Nocturnal during the Oblivion Crisis, and was later retrieved by her champion.[10]
The most famous feature of Nocturnal is the enchanted cowl she created. This headpiece possessed the ability to completely hide its wearer's identity from mortal knowledge, including magical forms of scrying and identification. The cowl's power was so great that people would be incapable of even remembering the name of whomever possessed the cowl, even while the cowl was not being worn. No one would be able to retain any long term memory of interacting with the cowl's wearer, and even removing the cowl in plain sight of others would not break its spell.
The cowl was reportedly stolen by the head of the Thieves Guild (Emer Dareloth) during the Third Era, promptly removing any memory of the person in question from history. Henceforth, according to legend, the bearer of the cowl was known only as ""Gray Fox,"" though it was not commonly known that the cowl was responsible for his infamy.
The cowl was also told stolen in a song called ""Song of Hrormir."" Nocturnal was tricked by Hrormir in order to save his old companion Darfang. She traded Darfang's soul for the service (by keeping his soul) of Hrormir, so that he would assist her followers dividing the kingdom of Aelfendor, but in the end the kingdom was left intact while Nocturnal's followers were divided. And the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal was also taken by Hrormir. To get the cowl back, Nocturnal was forced to release Hrormir's soul and left with nothing to gain.
The Skeleton Key was reportedly owned by a mortal for the first time by an obscured person named Arrovan. Many years later, the Eternal Champion during the Imperial Simulacrum found a map in a dungeon in Valenwood that pointed to the location of the Skeleton Key somewhere in Summerset Isle. Using the map, the Eternal Champion found and claimed the key. Then sometime in 3E 397, the Hero of Azra's Crossing found the Skeleton Key in one of the chests in the Citadel of Broken Wing. Indeed, the artifact travels between heroes and locations, as the legend says, it would never be the property of one thief for too long.
In Skyrim, the Skeleton Key was given a new level of importance and power. In the Thieves Guild story-line, the Dragonborn discovers that not only can the Key unlock physical barriers, but also metaphysical ones. As demonstrated by Mercer Frey in the ""Blindsighted"" quest, the Skeleton Key also unlocks human potential.
Frey's theft of the Skeleton Key from the Twilight Sepulcher's Inner Sanctum in the Fourth Era is said to be the reason for the hard times that have fallen on the Guild in Skyrim, since the Ebonmere, the gate to Nocturnal's plane of Oblivion, was kept open by the Skeleton Key, allowing luck to grace the actions of thieves throughout Nirn. It also allows the owner to pick any lock without the Skeleton Key breaking.
In Clockwork City, Nocturnal attempts to steal the Skeleton Key from Sotha Sil in order to take over the Clockwork City, hoping to potentially remake reality. She is stopped and cast out. Sotha Sil gives the key to Divayth Fyr for safekeeping.
For the reasons aforementioned the Skeleton Key might very well be the most powerful, if underestimated, Daedric artifact known.

/wiki/Nocturnal,"Nocturnal (in Daedric script, ) is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the night and darkness. She is also known as the Night Mistress[1] and Lady Luck.[2] The Cyrodiilic Thieves Guild leader, the Gray Fox, has the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal, which truly represents the sphere's darkness quality; it permanently removes the wearer's specific identity from all history. Regardless, the Cyrodiilic Thieves Guild venerates Nocturnal by ending talks with the saying ""Shadow hide you."" The summoning date of Nocturnal is 3rd of Hearthfire.[3]
Nocturnal and Azura have been referred to as sisters, though whether in the literal or the metaphorical sense is unknown.[3] Nocturnal is sometimes referred to as Ur-Dra,[4][note 1] referencing her claim as part of the original Void[5][6] She is thought to be the ""eldest and most powerful of the Daedric Princes.""[1] The Khajiit know her as Noctra, who can bring shadows and luck when called upon.[7]
Nocturnal, as she appears in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.
Physical descriptions of Nocturnal are difficult to come by, as she is usually described as being hidden by darkness and shadow. Depictions of the Daedric Prince usually take the form of a nondescript human woman, draped in a hooded cloak that hides most of her features and body. She is depicted with both arms outstretched, and a pair of Nightingales (or similar bird) perched on each wrist.
Nocturnal claims to be an aspect of the void of Oblivion itself, and takes such titles as Mother of Night or Night Mistress. Her very nature is such that humans cannot understand her, as she is the embodiment of the unfathomable and enigmatic. Worshipers of Nocturnal consist primarily of those who operate in darkness and night, such as thieves and spies. However, Nocturnal's deception is not usually meant to be harmful or violent in the manner of Boethiah. Rather, the unknowable nature of Nocturnal is the core of her being, and serves no real ulterior purposes beyond being mysterious. Thus, while thieves may consider Nocturnal their patron, assassins will typically lean towards a more violent deity, such as Molag Bal or Mephala.
Of Nocturnal, Karliah says she is, ""like a scolding mother who pushes her child to do better,"" meaning she appears to care about mortals, unlike some other Daedric Princes.
Although Nocturnal has arguably one of the largest followings of all the Daedric Princes, she has no form of organized clergy.

The Dragonborn recovers the item after a difficult dungeon quest, only to find it is damaged. Frustrated and disappointed, Nurelion pays the Dragonborn five  and takes to his bed, sick. The Dragonborn then talks to Quintus Navale, who intends to tend his master for his final days. Quintus gives the Dragonborn a more reasonable gift for the efforts involved.
When visiting him later he is sleeping in his bed. Attempting to talk to him will result in a message saying ""Nurelion is asleep and dying.""
Sometime thereafter, Quintus contacts the Dragonborn, asking for the collection of alchemical ingredients to help repair the broken phial. Succeeding at this, the Dragonborn brings the phial to Nurelion, who sees the fixed device he spent his entire life searching for. He dies shortly after.
Delvin Mallory may employ the Dragonborn to steal a Ruby from Nurelion. If the White Phial has previously been recovered for Nurelion, he falls ill and is in danger of dying. While in this state, he cannot be pickpocketed for the Ruby, since any attempt to do so results in the message, ""Nurelion is asleep and dying.""

Odahviing was killed sometime after the Dragon War and was buried in the southeast of Skyrim near Riften.[1]
During the Dragon Crisis in 4E 201, he was revived by Alduin to act as his lieutenant.
In order to find the final location of Alduin, the Dragonborn must capture and interrogate Odahviing. To lure Odahviing into the trap, the Dragonborn must use Dragonrend to force him to land, and walk backwards into Dragonsreach, causing him to be trapped. While captured, Odahviing bargains with the Dragonborn for his freedom. For his release, he trades the Dragonborn his loyalty and safe passage to Alduin's temple of Skuldafn, high in the eastern mountains and reachable only by flight.
After the Dragonborn slays Alduin and is shouted back to the Throat of the World, the Dragons acknowledge the Dragonborn's Thu'um and began flying out and shouting, with Paarthurnax pledging to lead the Dragons and teach them the Way of the Voice. Odahviing then came down to the Dragonborn, wishing Paarthurnax success on his quest to make the dragons follow the Way of the Voice.
Odahviing was already impressed twice over after the battle and pledged his life to the service of the Dragonborn, claiming that he will come to the aid of the Dragonborn whenever the Dragonborn needs help, if he can. Then he flies away and later can be seen circling the top of the Throat of the World.

/wiki/Olaf_One-Eye,"Olaf One-Eye is a named Draugr found in the crypt of Dead Men's Respite. In life, he was a Jarl of Whiterun who rose to power as a High King of Skyrim during the First Era (reigned 1E 420[1] – 1E 452[1]) after defeating the dragon Numinex atop Mount Anthor. He is also the primary antagonist of the Bards College's storyline.[2]
During the Burning of King Olaf festival, Olaf is depicted as a tyrant, and an effigy of him is burned. During the quest ""Tending the Flames,"" a book called King Olaf's Verse must be obtained, before the Bards College can open classes to the Dragonborn. One of the choices for rewriting the Verse includes changing the character of Olaf into Numinex.
According to Adonato Leotelli's account, Olaf and the Dragon, Olaf One-Eye fought the dragon Numinex with the aid of the Thu'um, in the presence of several witnesses. Drawing the battle toward Whiterun, Olaf contained the dragon within a prison in the Cloud District. The people of Whiterun renamed the keep Dragonsreach in honor of this task. Numinex stayed there, trapped, until his death.[3]
Olaf became High King of Skyrim after the battle, facing mixed opinions from his peers. Because most witnesses of his victory against Numinex became extremely wealthy after he became High King, many believed that they were paid to provide false testimony to the events that took place atop Mount Anthor. Sometime during Olaf's reign as High King, Olaf expanded Skyrim's boundaries when he conquered the Reach.[1]
The poet Svaknir wrote a heretical elegy, defaming Olaf and labeling him a traitor. Copies of Svaknir's script were burned until none remained, save the one buried with Olaf in Dead Men's Respite, the tomb of Olaf where Svaknir's body was also laid to rest in. Even this script was badly damaged, forcing the Dragonborn to rewrite it with Viarmo, the headmaster of the Bards College.
Viarmo tasks the Dragonborn with recovering Svaknir's lost verse, said to still reside in Olaf's tomb. The verse is needed to convince Jarl Elisif the Fair of the legitimacy of the Burning of Olaf festival the [Bards College wishes to perform. During the recovery of the manuscript, Olaf, whose body has become a Draugr, attacks and is defeated by the Dragonborn.
The Dragonborn can pass a persuade test to change Olaf's history, where it can be rewritten to show Olaf as actually being a dragon in human form.
The spirit of Olaf states that, despite Svaknir's defaming words, he respects the bard as an honest opponent, and wished to greet him as a friend in the Hall of Valor, meaning that there could have been some truth to Svaknir’s account of Olaf’s capture of the dragon.

These Mages had taken a liking to him, and made him feel included, so when they left the college to continue their illegal research at Fellglow Keep, Orthorn stole some books from The Arcanaeum and took off after them, using the books as a peace offering to ingratiate himself into the clan.
One of the books he stole had references to the Eye of Magnus, relating a theory that there may have been something the ancient Nords were hiding under Saarthal that provoked the Elves to attack, entitled Night of Tears.

Otar the Mad (Dragon Language:  Otar), is one of the named dragon priests in Skyrim.
Otar was an ancient Nordic chieftain who ruled over the city of Ragnvald in the Merethic Era. Initially, he was believed to have been a benevolent ruler and highly successful in battle, but his mind was corrupted by unknown forces that drove him to insanity. Otar became a Dragon Priest and subjected his people to great cruelty until two Nordic heroes named Saerek and Torsten were sent to stop his tyranny.[1]
Owing to Otar's immense power, both heroes were unable to defeat him despite their most valiant efforts, so they instead resorted to permanently sealing him in a large sarcophagus in Ragnvald and locked it with two skull keys that each of them kept. They pledged to defend the keys with their lives so that Otar would never escape his imprisonment. The city of Ragnvald was eventually abandoned, but Saerek and Torsten remained as his guardians.[1]
Otar can be encountered within the Nordic ruin of Ragnvald in The Reach. He is sealed in a large, locked sarcophagus in the main chamber of the ruin. Opening the sarcophagus is only possible by defeating the guardians, Torsten and Saerek, who each hold a Skull Key. Both skull keys are required to open the lock.

Quaranir wants to speak with the Dragonborn privately, and magically veils their conversation from Savos and Ancano.
Time is fleeting, so he is quick to impart that the Order has had little success in contacting the Dragonborn previously and that this is probably because of the Eye of Magnus.

Igmund thinks that the Legion should be gathered and drive the Forsworn out of the Reach, though Raerek disagrees, as he says the Legion doesn't know about the hills of the Reach and the caves that make up those hills. He then says that the Forsworn will hide and ambush every assault. Raerek believes the best way to defeat the Forsworn is to wait them out.

Later, the Dragonborn has the opportunity to rejoin Ralof and escape from Helgen.

/wiki/Red_Eagle,"Red Eagle, also known as Faolan in Old Reach Native[source?], was a legendary hero of the Reachmen, who despite being forsaken and exiled by the ruling elders of his people, managed to defend the Reach from legions of the Alessian Empire until Empress Hestra mobilized a force ""unlike any before.""[1]
Red Eagle was born in the Sundered Hills, deep within The Reach, around 1E 1030.[1] As a boy, the village priests foresaw his destiny. He was to become a great warrior and leader, who would unite and lead the ten warring kings who ruled the Reach at the time. As the years passed, Red Eagle grew in power and influence and became a prosperous and well known leader.
Around 1E 1055, Hestra, Empress of Cyrodiil, attempted an invasion of The Reach. The old kings resisted, but were either killed or bribed to fall under the banner of the Alessian Empire. Eventually, Hestra's legions arrived at Sundered Hills and envoys were sent to bargain for their surrender.
Red Eagle refused to yield the freedom of his people, but the elders were afraid, cast him out, and accepted the Imperial yoke.[1]
Despite his expulsion from Sundered Hills, Red Eagle still held great influence among his people. He gathered Reachmen loyal to himself and his belief that the Reach should be free from Imperial oppression. Together they formed a resistance and successfully carried out raids on the seemingly endless number of Imperial patrols and garrisons throughout The Reach.[1]
One night Red Eagle was approached by a cloaked stranger who revealed herself to be a Hagraven. She offered him power, for a price. Red Eagle agreed to the pact and sacrificed his heart, his will and his humanity to become a Briarheart. The Reachmen are allied with Molag Bal, but it is not known if his deal was with the lord of discord specifically.[2] Nevertheless, from that day forth, his was a spirit of vengeance; he was pitiless and beyond remorse. The Reachmen resistance grew in strength and numbers, and within two years Red Eagle managed to drive the Imperial Legions from The Reach.[1]
Despite Red Eagle's initial victory, Empress Hestra returned to The Reach with an army unlike any before. For two weeks Hestra's generals laid siege to Red Eagle's stronghold until he emerged, alone and robed in nothing but his flaming sword. It was said that he fought well into the night and slaughtered a thousand Imperials before he was slain. His kin buried his body in Rebel's Cairn, a hidden tomb deep within the rock.
According to legend, he presented his legendary sword to his people, and swore an oath: Fight on, and when at last The Reach was free, his blade should be returned to his tomb so that he might rise and lead them again.[1]
In the Fourth Era, the descendants of the Reachmen, the Forsworn, draw several parallels to the struggles of Red Eagle and his oppression under an occupying force. As such, many of them extol the teachings and practices of Red Eagle and look up to him as a paragon. Indeed, the Sundered Towers became a stronghold for the Forsworn and Red Eagle's Fury was even wielded by their Briarheart leader. This leader was slain by the Dragonborn and the sword was claimed. It was then used to open Red Eagle's tomb and the undead Reachman was defeated. His sword then became Red Eagle's Bane.
Red Eagle can be encountered in Rebel's Cairn at the conclusion of this quest, which is initiated by reading the book The Legend of Red Eagle.
Approaching the coffin at the back of the room will cause Red Eagle to rise up along with four skeletal archers at different points around the room. He will typically appear as a leveled draugr boss, but may appear as a common dragon priest at higher levels.
Red Eagle wields a unique Nordic sword called Red Eagle's Fury, but sometimes it can be a Honed Nordic Greatsword of Burning. At higher levels (approx. 40), Red Eagle can be encountered as a dragon priest, though he will not drop a mask. Red Eagle uses the shouts Disarm and Unrelenting Force. If the Dragonborn is having trouble defeating him, circling around his coffin and using a bow or spells to damage him may be useful. Unrelenting Force or Ice Form shouts can be used to knock him down, giving free rein to the Dragonborn to attack while Red Eagle is down. Another possibility is using a Destruction-type staff such as Staff of Fireballs. Using it will make the battle a bit easier. Summons or followers can be very useful as well, distracting Red Eagle or his skeletons.
An extremely effective way of defeating him is to back-track up the stairs, to the doorway of the secret door. Then use Unrelenting Force to throw him down the stairs, which will damage him quite a lot due to the height of the fall. Then run back and take back Red Eagle's Bane from the altar which you put Red Eagle's Fury into. This action results in the door shutting in his face. He will be stuck down there, giving the Dragonborn time to recharge dragon shouts. The door can then be opened when needed to shout him back down again. Repeat until he is defeated. Fire magic and shouts can be used to seriously harm him, as undead are weak to fire.",Red Eagle,,,,,Radiant,791731,792840

She has much pride in what she does. This is demonstrated by dialogue with the Dragonborn, where she claims to see ""jealousy"" in their eyes when talking about the healthy crops at her farm, and claiming that there is nothing ""more noble"" than farming.
Your farm is doing very well. You must be proud. ""Do I detect a bit of jealousy in your tone? I would hardly blame you. What calling could be more noble than this? I see in your eyes that you think I jest. I assure you, I don't. I am proud, and rightfully so, of the work we do here. Working the soil with your hands, seeing your seeds take root and grow, tending a herd... there is a joy in honest labor you won't find elsewhere."" Where do you sell your surplus crops? ""In Whiterun, mostly. Ennis handles the business arrangements, but I know that he has a few purchasers who give us a fair price. Ennis prides himself on his shrewd business schemes. For my part, I'm far happier working with cattle and crops than with people.""
Reldith ""The way our crops have been growing, Rorikstead must have the richest soil in the Hold."" Ennis ""Maybe we should start selling the soil along with the dung. We could make a tidy profit."" Reldith ""Ha! Who in their right mind would pay for dirt? You'd get laughed out of Whiterun for even trying it."" Ennis ""Hey, people pay money for stranger things. Take our cow dung - we sell that by the wagon load."" Reldith ""When you're rich you can waste as much money as you like on farfetched business ideas. In the meantime, there's a farm to run.""
Ennis ""Have you given my idea any more thought? You said you'd let me know yesterday, and that obviously didn't happen."" Reldith ""Oh, I don't know. Yes, we'd make more money, but I don't like the idea of you traveling alone out there with the war and talk of dragons."" Ennis ""Come on now, we discussed that.

Revyn asks the Dragonborn to return a gold ring to Viola Giordano, as he believes it is stolen. The Dragonborn can either stealthily slip the ring into Viola's bureau or give it straight to her.
If the Dragonborn follows Revyn's orders without being seen, Revyn rewards the Dragonborn with leveled gold and becomes available as a Speech trainer, as well as a marriage candidate. Should the Dragonborn simply hand the ring to Viola and tell her where it came from, she rewards the Dragonborn with leveled gold and also informs the Jarl of the situation. This action results in Revyn's shop having an increased tax, thus causing his wares to be more expensive. It will also cause Revyn to dislike the Dragonborn, and address him/her as a ""miserable wretch"" every time he is interacted with.
Also, the option to marry Revyn will be lost if the Dragonborn speaks directly to Viola, even while wearing the Amulet of Mara. Thus, the ring must be returned to Viola's house covertly for the option of marriage to appear.

He is an experienced traveling merchant, having visited Skyrim on many earlier occasions. According to Ma'dran, it was Ri'saad's idea to come to Skyrim during the Civil War, as he saw great opportunity where others saw danger.
He claims to not be welcome in Elsweyr or Cyrodiil most likely due to his Moon Sugar dealings. According to Adonato Leotelli, a famous author living in Windhelm, he came to Skyrim with Ri'saad and his caravan. During a Falmer attack, one of Ri'saad's associates, Bhisha, was killed. Leotelli says that this saved them all.
If spoken to during the quest to find the Thalmor assassin after Malborn (provided he survived the events of ""Diplomatic Immunity""), Ri'saad will gladly point out J'datharr and remark on how his filthy Thalmor affiliations give all Khajiit a bad name, indicating that he despises the Thalmor and any Khajiit who work with them.
Ri'saad travels with Atahbah and Ma'randru-jo, two fellow Khajiit travelers. The trio is protected by Khayla, their guard. However, many of the merchants from other Khajiit caravans cite Ri'saad as the one who led them to Skyrim.
If the Dragonborn becomes a Thieves Guild member, at one point they deliver moon sugar to him, despite the fact that he complains about being denied access to cities due to Nordic stereotyping of Khajiit as skooma dealers and thieves. Doing so unlocks all Khajiit trading caravan merchants as fences for stolen goods.
If Malborn survives after ""Diplomatic Immunity,"" he will be found hiding in the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm from the Khajiit Thalmor assassin, J'datharr. Ri'saad may be found near the assassin outside the city and the Dragonborn may ask about J'datharr being part of his caravans. Ri'saad will deny this and will admit his dislike for the Thalmor.

Upon completion of the Companions' main plotline, Ria can be recruited as a follower and becomes a potential marriage candidate. She can be recruited into the Blades if the Dragonborn talks to Delphine while having her as a follower, or as a steward if the Hearthfire DLC has been installed.
Ria states she has dreamed of being a Companion since she was a little girl, and is very enthusiastic about her membership. She is determined to fight and die alongside her Shield-Siblings.[1]
The Dragonborn typically meets Ria for the first time near Pelagia Farm, where, along with Farkas and Aela the Huntress, she is fighting a giant. If spoken to, she asks the Dragonborn to come to Jorrvaskr and join the Companions.
Ria can also be encountered randomly in the wilds of Skyrim, travelling with Vilkas.
After becoming Harbinger of the Companions by completing the quest ""Glory of the Dead,"" Ria becomes a candidate for marriage if the Dragonborn possesses and wears an Amulet of Mara. After her marriage to the Dragonborn, she may leave the house in order to complete jobs, but she returns in a day or two if she has not been killed in the wilderness.

With Hearthfire installed, Ria can become a Steward at one of the Dragonborn's manors. She must be close to the house before the speech option will appear.

He is one of the miners of Kynesgrove, just south of Windhelm, in the Braidwood Inn or Steamscorch Mine during the day. Sometimes he is sleeping outside the inn at night.
Roggi states that his ancestor Lenne was one of the original founders of Kynesgrove; one day Lenne explored an undiscovered cave and was eaten by monsters, becoming lost along with his ancestral shield.
He has a particular infatuation with mead, and the majority of his dialogue is concerned with the drink, of which he regularly imbibes a significant amount. He is also a proud man who refuses to take a handout from Iddra to pay the bar debts he owes her, even though he is constantly unable to pay those debts.
Roggi owes Iddra quite some coin for his mead-swilling ways at the inn; talking to both about this debt has several resolutions.
Roggi will give the Dragonborn a miscellaneous quest to find his ancestral shield. Once they find the shield he will offer to follow them and also becomes an option for marriage if an Amulet of Mara is worn.
Roggi's primary skills are Smithing, Alchemy, and Enchanting. His secondary skills are One-Handed, Two-Handed, and Archery. His tertiary skills are Light Armor, Sneak, and Speech.
His default equipment is limited to his default clothes, and a hunting bow with iron arrows. He also starts out with a steel dagger, gold ruby necklace, and his ancestral shield, all of which can be removed from his inventory through trading.
Roggi will favor light armor over heavy armor, and benefits slightly more from it, although not to a dramatic degree since his skill in both is fairly low. Likewise, his skill in one-handed weapons vs. two-handed weapons are roughly on par with each other, as is his skill in archery.
He is a law-abiding citizen, and will refuse to commit any crimes on your behalf (including theft or assault). He will, however, defend you against the wrath of angered citizens and guards.
Along with Sven, Roggi has the lowest level cap among all available followers, maxing out at level 20. His overall health and combat skills are quite mediocre compared to most other followers, making him one of the comparatively weakest followers. Roggi is a miner, not a professional warrior, and his stats reflect this; at level 20 a Housecarl or any other Warrior-type follower like Lydia has more than 300 health, compared to only 208 for Roggi. Additionally, his primary specialization is in crafting skills (Smithing, Alchemy, and Enchanting).
His morale is only average, and he will often flee from combat if seriously injured instead of standing and fighting to the end.",Roggi Knot-Beard,Male Nord,MaleNord,Nord,Male,,110724,81983
/wiki/Roggvir,"Roggvir was a Nord warrior and, formerly, one of the Hold Guards of Solitude.
Roggvir lived in Solitude all his life, growing up with his sister Greta and locals Sorex Vinius and Vivienne Onis. According to Sorex, Roggvir was a cruel and immature boy in his childhood, who often pulled practical jokes, such as leaving a beehive in Sorex's bed, and humiliating him whenever in the presence of Vivienne, whom Sorex had feelings for.
When his sister married local fisherman and stall Vendor Addvar, Roggvir became an uncle to the young girl Svari, who was fond of him.
Roggvir was a member of the city guard at the time of High King Torygg's death at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak. Immediately after the incident, Roggvir, who was presumably on gate guard duty opened the city gates and allowed Ulfric to escape. For this, he was branded a traitor and sentenced to death. He was a proud Nord and Stormcloak sympathizer, defending Ulfric's actions as honorable even in the face of death.
His sister, Greta, stopped going to the Temple of the Divines after his death, while his niece Svari was also very upset. Addvar tried explaining to her that people must be held accountable for their actions, however this did not console her, but as he states ""a child feels what she will.""
Captain Aldis, who presided over his execution, respected Roggvir, labelling him as a ""fine and honorable man"" when in conversation with the Dragonborn, although saying his execution was justified and necessary. Also, after the crowd disperses at the execution, he looks down at Roggvir's corpse and says, ""Damn shame Roggvir, you were a good man.""
Upon entering Solitude for the first time, the Dragonborn witnesses Roggvir's execution. Before death, he exclaims that Ulfric challenged Torygg in single combat, and won honorably. As such, it was the way of the Nords to allow Ulfric to leave, as he had done nothing wrong.
Despite his claimed innocence, Roggvir is still executed for treason. If the Dragonborn tries to stop the execution, whether by attacking the guards or simply walking onto the execution platform, Roggvir will make a run for it. If the guards are distracted long enough, he can escape. But if the Hold Guards are not distracted enough, they, Ahtar, and Captain Aldis will rapidly stab and kill Roggvir and the Dragonborn will be attacked, but receive no bounty. However, he will either disappear or drop dead if the Dragonborn attempts to speak with him, and all NPCs still comment as if he were executed. Attacking Roggvir before he is killed will cause the guards to become hostile, but will accrue no bounty. If saved, Roggvir will sometimes go to the grindstone near his planned execution site and work on a sword. He will not leave the grindstone unless the Dragonborn attempts to use it.
Entering Solitude for the first time through the side gate will cause the Dragonborn to miss the execution. However, dialogue options with NPCs will still be as if the Dragonborn had witnessed the execution (note: After taking over the city of Solitude with the Stormcloaks, the guards talk about how it is ""too bad they could not have gotten here in time to save Roggvir""). If the Dragonborn kills Ahtar, Captain Aldis, and the guard with them before Roggvir's death, Roggvir will die shortly after, since he is programmed to die regardless of the Dragonborn's actions.
Speaking to Svari, the daughter of Roggvir's sister, Greta, about her mother starts a miscellaneous quest to convince Greta to return to the Temple of the Divines. This entails recovering Roggvir's Amulet of Talos off of his body and giving it to Greta.

If the Dragonborn murders Rondach, Ainethach, the leader of Karthwasten, will send hired thugs to kill them. Rondach can also send out thugs if the Dragonborn kills Ainethach or Voada. This is because the Creation Kit lists Voada and Rondach as Ainethach's children. However, there is no in-game dialogue or text that refers to their relation to Ainethach. Furthermore, he will send hired thugs if anything is stolen from him.
Rondach may be selected as a pickpocket target by Delvin Mallory for Thieves Guild.

/wiki/Rorik,"Rorik is a Nord landowner in Rorikstead. He is in charge of the village.
Rorik is a slightly gloomy man in his older years. He claims to have changed a lot for the worse since the war and that he has lost his charm years ago.
Rorik was a Legate in the Imperial Army during the Great War, in which he commanded a force of several dozen soldiers, most of which were from the Hold of Whiterun. Unfortunately, an Aldmeri soldier ran Rorik through with his blade during the battle, and left him to die. However, Rorik was saved by Jouane Manette, a Breton healer.[source?]
After the war, he re-founded the settlement of Rorikstead. The town had existed since the First Era, when it was called Rorik's Steading,[1] over a thousand years before Rorik was born. The settlement did not exist during the events of The Elder Scrolls: Arena in the Third Era.
Rorik, along with Jouane, resides in Rorik's Manor, the northernmost building in Rorikstead.
Rorik is a possible target needed to be intimidated by initiating a brawl.
Rorik is a possible target needed to be rescued from Redoran's Retreat.
Is the town of Rorikstead named for you? ""Yes, that's right. Look around you. Most of the lands you see are mine. Most of this I purchased while my comrades were fighting in the south, helping the Empire against the Aldmeri Dominion. Back then, nothing would grow here and so the land was worthless. Now, thanks to hard work and the gods' blessings, our farms prosper.""
Has the war taken a toll on your settlement and its people? ""Not yet, anyway, though it certainly could. With most of the hold's fighting men committed to the war, there are fewer swords to keep the roads safe from brigands and wild beasts. And of course, as the war drags on and supplies run low, our ample fields and stores of food will make a tempting target for desperate men. The best we can hope for a swift end to the conflict.

/wiki/Sanguine,"Sanguine (in Daedric script, ) also known as the Lord of Revelry,[1] Blood-Made-Pleasure,[2] Prince of Hedonism,[UL 1] Daedric Lord of Debauchery or Daedric Prince of Debauchery, Lord of Hard-Partying,[3] and he who tastes the Shaven Fruit,[4] is the Daedric Prince of revelry and debauchery. He also has domain over the darker natures of man, such as lust, sin, sloth, gluttony, and greed. He is the patron deity of sinners and is often seen with a bottle of wine or beer (ale) in his hand. Sanguine enjoys playing pranks on others, one such example being a spell that removes the clothing of everyone within the spell's radius. Although a joker, Sanguine prefers to drag mortals down to sinful lifestyles by means of temptation and humiliation. In Khajiiti religion he is known as Sangiin, the Blood Cat, who is known to test the Khajiit with promises of immortality and debaucheries of the flesh.[5][6][7]
He has over a thousand personal realms known as Myriad Realms of Revelry.[8]
Sanguine was once asked by Mephala for twenty-seven tokens to give to her devoted followers. The Dark Brotherhood stole these tokens from the Morag Tong. According to Morag Tong members, Mephala eventually arranged for them to return to the guild. The Nerevarine systematically killed the members of the Dark Brotherhood one-by-one and retrieved the tokens from them.
Sanguine can be called upon at the Shrine of Sanguine, whose name does not fit the common pattern of ""(Daedra Prince)'s Shrine."" The summoning date of Sanguine is 16th of Sun's Dawn. Sanguine can also be summoned in his shrine, if the summoner offered Cyrodilic Brandy.
There is a shrine in Cyrodiil which bears the appearance of Sanguine. Upon completing the related quest, Sanguine will give the Sanguine Rose, a strange staff shaped like a twisted and thorny black rose. When the energy within the Sanguine Rose is cast at a target, one random Daedric servant of Sanguine is summoned to do battle. This staff has very little charge, between 10–30 uses, depending on Conjuration skill level, and must be recharged often.
When the Hero of Kvatch visited the Shrine of Sanguine and summoned him, sometime during the Oblivion Crisis, Sanguine tasked the Hero of Kvatch to join the royal dinner party of the Countess of Leyawiin, Alessia Caro. Sanguine believed that the Countess of Leyawiin was too stuffy, and wanted the hero to do something about it. The hero should sneak into the castle undetected and cast the spell of Stark Reality on her and her guests. When the hero cast the spell all the guests and the Countess herself were stripped, it brought chaos to the party, but Sanguine was pleased. When the hero returned to the shrine, Sanguine rewarded his Sanguine Rose to the hero of Kvatch, a staff that has the capability to summon a lesser Daedra to ""supposedly"" fight for the wielder of the staff. The same artifact was also rewarded some decades before to the Hero of Daggerfall, and also to Martin, the last of the Septims. Martin in his youth was one of the followers of a Daedric Cult, and he somehow retrieved Sanguine's Rose - probably after some odd task.
Sanguine appears in Skyrim disguised as Sam Guevenne, who offers a friendly drinking competition with his ""special"" brew for his staff with the Dragonborn. If the Dragonborn accepts, the quest ""A Night to Remember"" will start. After the Dragonborn accepts and drinks three mugs, Sam, impressed, will give the staff and offers to show the Dragonborn a place ""where the wine flows like water."" After that, they go out to commit drunken pranks in Skyrim, and eventually the Dragonborn awakes at the temple of Dibella and sets out to correct the pranks pulled while drunk. The Dragonborn then heads to Morvunskar where a portal to Sam's location is found. Going through the portal reveals Sam in the Misty Grove, where he reveals his true identity as Sanguine, commenting that he hadn't had that much fun in a hundred years and rewards the Dragonborn with his staff.
It is possible to turn Sanguine hostile by commanding a follower to attack him. However, arrows, melee weapons, and spells will still continue to pass through him and he cannot be damaged. Sanguine will simply attack repeatedly for very meager damage with what appears to be a dagger of some sort. This will at least yield a few more lines of dialogue while he attacks.
Sanguine does not appear directly in The Elder Scrolls Online. However, he seems to exert influence by trapping partygoers within his temple in Shadowfen. His servant Seducer Trilvath tasks the Vestige with entrapping some Aldmeri Dominion spies by making them drink from Sanguine's goblet.
He has several followers called Sanguine's Revelers. They can be found in Sanguine's Demesne in Shadowfen, as well as at a camp in White Fall Valley in Cyrodiil, and occasionally in Trader's Cove.

At some point, when Aren was an apprentice, he followed an ill-fated group of mages through Labyrinthian, led by the Arch-Mage's favorite pupil, Atmah. The trip resulted in the deaths of everyone present except Savos. In an attempt to seal away the dragon priest Morokei permanently, he forced two of the surviving mages to remain behind, magically enthralled and forced to maintain a barrier around the dragon priest to keep him restrained.
Savos returned to the college and eventually earned the title of Arch-Mage, leading the other mages with an air that suggested that he believed that everything would eventually work itself out.
Upon returning from Saarthal after discovering the Eye of Magnus, Savos Aren awards the Dragonborn with an enchanted item (either a ring, necklace, staff or circlet), then sends him or her to retrieve several books from the Arcanaeum to learn more about the strange artifact.
Discovering that the Staff of Magnus is hidden at Labyrinthian, the Dragonborn returns to the college, to find that Ancano has sealed himself in the Hall of the Elements with the Eye. With Mirabelle Ervine and the Dragonborn in tow, Savos breaks through the barrier he has erected and attempts to confront the Thalmor agent, only for Arcano to unleash some sort of explosion of magic from the Eye. During the event, the Dragonborn is temporarily stunned. Upon waking, he or she finds Mirabelle wounded in the Hall. She instructs the Dragonborn to search for Savos. In the courtyard, the other students and staff surround his body, which was transported there by the combined effort of Ancano's magic and the Eye's power. While returning to Mirabelle, she gives the Dragonborn the Torc of Labyrinthian and Savos Aren's Amulet and tells him or her to retrieve the Staff.
The Dragonborn will succeed Savos as the new Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold after his death and stopping Ancano, with the Psijic Order transporting the Eye away for safekeeping under their watch.

Afterwards, he cursed her ability to cast spells and chased her off into the depths of the sanctum, where she seemingly got caught in a web of one of the Frostbite Spiders that inhabit the cave.

/wiki/Septimus_Signus,"Septimus Signus is an elderly scholar living in isolation at an outpost north of the College of Winterhold.
As a crazed scholar on the Elder Scrolls, Septimus wrote the book, Ruminations on the Elder Scrolls, which attempts to describe the nature of the prophetic scrolls with obscure metaphors. He wrote the book while he was still a member of the College of Winterhold, departing after having read one of the Scrolls and becoming irrevocably mad.
Looking for Dwemer artifacts, he wandered out on the small glacial islands north-west of Winterhold. Here, he proceeded to attempt to access a Dwemer contraption. He was believed to be driven insane by his own genius, and the long periods away from people, although he admits reading the Elder Scrolls caused his madness.
After speaking to Paarthurnax atop the Throat of the World, the Dragonborn learns that an Elder Scroll is needed to learn Dragonrend, a powerful shout created by mortals for the purpose of knocking Dragons from the sky.
Urag gro-Shub supplies the Dragonborn with reading material on the Elder Scrolls, one of which is the book authored by Septimus. Suspecting that he is the most likely to know where an Elder Scroll may be, the Dragonborn locates him north of the College of Winterhold, at an outpost.
Once found and spoken to, he sends the Dragonborn to Alftand with a Lexicon, a device created by the Dwemer that allows one to safely transcribe the text of an Elder Scroll without going blind or insane.
Septimus believes that the Heart of Lorkhan is held within the Dwemer Oculory, but the Oghma Infinium is what is actually inside. The blood of a Dwemer is needed to open the contraption, but since there are no more Dwemer, Septimus says that the blood of every other Mer race will suffice, thus the blood of an Orsimer, a Falmer, a Bosmer, an Altmer, and a Dunmer must be collected.
Exiting the outpost reveals that Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora seeks the object within the Dwarven Mechanism and has only tolerated Septimus' involvement with it because it served his own plot. The Dragonborn can choose to aid Hermaeus or decline the Lord's offer. Neither option directly affects the outcome of unlocking the mechanism.
Once acquiring and giving the blood samples to Septimus, he opens the contraption in his outpost and is extremely disappointed to not see the Heart of Lorkhan. He then disintegrates into a pile of ash as he approaches the Oghma Infinium. The Dragonborn can then take the Oghma Infinium.
I've inscribed the lexicon. ""Give it, quickly. Extraordinary. I see it now. The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals.

/wiki/Sheogorath,"WabbajackStaff of the EverscampFork of HorripilationSpear of Bitter MercyStaff of SheogorathGambolpuddyFolium Discognitum
Sheogorath (in Daedric script, ) is the Daedric Prince of Madness. His realm in Oblivion is known as the Shivering Isles,[1] otherwise known as the Madhouse or ""The Asylums"" [UL 1]. It is separated into two distinct communities: Mania, the fantastic, colorful side, where art enthusiasts and insane revelers reside, and Dementia, the horrific, dark and ominous side, inhabited by those with the darker side of Sheogorath's blessings.[1] Sheogorath is attended by his Chamberlain Haskill and the Nobles of his realm, the Duke and Duchess of Mania and Dementia.[2] He is also the main antagonist in the Mages Guild questline in The Elder Scrolls Online.
Sheogorath is one of the few Daedric Princes whose creation may be linked to the change or destruction of an Aedra; others include Malacath and Meridia. Aldmeri creation stories attribute his creation to the removal of Lorkhan's ""divine spark."" In one of these myths, he is described as the ""Sithis-shaped hole"" of the world.[3] However, in an interview conducted by the Imperial Library, Haskill states this interpretation of the creation of Sheogorath may not be the case.[UL 2]
In search of the Mantella in the Aetherius realm known as the Mantellan Crux, Sheogorath appeared and helped the hero in accomplishing their goal.[4]
The Shivering Isles is explained by Haskill to be whatever Lord Sheogorath wills it to be; inside the gates of the exotic and twisted land boasts striking new wildlife (unseen on Nirn) and the oddest oddities of creatures, including Baliwogs, Grummites and the deadly Scalon.
The government is split into three factions: Duke of Mania, Duchess of Dementia and Sheogorath himself. The names are self-evident when looking at Dementia's Crucible and Mania's Bliss.
At the end of the Third Era, Sheogorath sent an invitation to Tamriel by way of a strange door in Niben Bay. The Madgod demanded a mortal Champion to face his foes. Throughout the course of the expansion, the Hero of Kvatch learns that Sheogorath is in fact Jyggalag, the Daedric Prince of Order. He tells the Hero that at the end of every era he becomes Jyggalag again, and lays waste to his own Realm. After the Champion eventually defeats Jyggalag, he explains that in ancient times he was one of the more powerful Daedra Lords. The influence of his sphere was so great that the other Daedric Princes grew jealous and feared him. They cursed him to live as Sheogorath, the incarnation of the thing he hated most.[5]
At the end of every Era, Jyggalag is allowed to take on his true form once again, and bring order to his realm, an event known as the Greymarch. After the Greymarch, however, he is transformed back into Sheogorath, who spreads madness upon the realm once more. The Champion can end this cycle by defeating Jyggalag during the Greymarch occurring at the end of the Third Era. This releases him from his curse, allowing him to remain in his true form instead of transforming back into Sheogorath. After defeating Jyggalag at the end of the expansion, the Champion is named the new Sheogorath.[6]
During the Fourth Era and Dragon Crisis, Sheogorath is ""on vacation"" in the mind of Pelagius Septim III and his absence from the Shivering Isles is felt by his servant Dervenin who asks the Last Dragonborn to convince the Mad God to return to the Isles. The Dragonborn finds themselves in Pelagius's mind and dressed in a Fine Hat and clothes. After introductions, and delivering Dervenian's request, Sheogorath explains to the Dragonborn that the only way to leave is to ""cure"" Pelagius's brain and tasks the Dragonborn to do so, and gives the hero the Wabbajack to help. After completing Sheogorath's tasks, Sheogorath agrees to leave and allowed the Dragonborn to keep the Wabbajack and clothes. He even asks that the Dragonborn ""look him up"" if they ever find themselves in the Shivering Isles. He even takes Dervenin with him back to Oblivion.[7]
Sheogorath, as summoned in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.
Sheogorath often appears on Nirn as a well-dressed elderly gentleman, which many mortals do not expect.
Sheogorath during his vacations in Pelagius the Mad's mind.
Originally, Sheogorath was one of the Daedric Princes whom the Chimer, now Dunmer, revered in their ancient ancestral worship. However, when the Tribunal Temple became the dominating religion in Morrowind, Sheogorath—along with Mehrunes Dagon, Malacath, and Molag Bal—became known as one of the ""Four Corners of the House of Troubles.""[8] He was said to rebel against the Tribunal, and thus worship of Sheogorath became punishable by death. His role in Dunmer culture is to test them for any psychological weakness, and is associated with the fear other races have of the Dunmer.
When he rebelled against the Tribunal, Sheogorath tricked the moon Baar Dau, inspiring it to hurl itself at the city of Vivec. Sheogorath justified his actions by claiming Vivec was built in mockery of the heavens. Vivec is then said to have frozen Baar Dau in its descent, and the moon swore itself to the Tribunal's service forever. Today, the Tribunal Temple requires a pilgrimage to this moon, called the Shrine of Daring.
Sheogorath is one of the many prominent Daedric Princes in the culture of the Khajiit people. In the Khajiit myth of creation, Sheogorath is called ""Sheggorath."" He is known as the ""Skooma Cat"" in Elsweyr.
Sheoggorath was believed to have been born from the union of Ahnurr and Fadomai. He is an adversarial spirit that tests Khajiit on the Path by making them doubt the truth of their own thoughts, beliefs, and actions. He must be faced along the Path and be overcome before a Khajiit can visit Hermorah's library.[9] Some Khajiit tribes believe Sheggorath is dead and has been replaced by something Other.[10]
Sheogorath's status as a Daedric Prince and as a member of the ""Four Corners of the House of Troubles"" has made his mainstream worship largely taboo. Throughout Tamriel, however, there are small shrines where the devoted worship the madgod in secret. However, there is one holiday that is at least loosely related to Sheogorath. The second of Sun's Dawn is when Mad Pelagius day is celebrated. According to Gwinas, on this day there are great festivals and invocations at the shrines of Sheogorath.
There are six artifacts made by Sheogorath which are known on the mortal plane. The best-known of these is the staff known as Wabbajack. It can transform a creature into something else, turn them into piles of cheese, or instant death, though it is impossible to predict the result, much like Sheogorath himself. This artifact can be found in the games Daggerfall, Oblivion, Skyrim and Online, after doing tasks for Sheogorath, as part of certain quests. Another artifact is the Gambolpuddy glove, which fortifies half of the user's attributes while draining the other half. Gambolpuddy is seen in Morrowind, where it was found under a pillow in Ald Daedroth. His third artifact is the Fork of Horripilation, a fork which drains the user's magicka. It was given by the Statue of Sheogorath in Ihinipalit, in St. Delyn's Canton's Waterworks in Morrowind. The fourth artifact worth noting is the Staff of the Everscamp. This unique artifact in Oblivion summoned four Everscamps who could be neither banished nor killed. The fifth artifact of Sheogorath is the Spear of Bitter Mercy which can summon a Frost Atronach wherever the holder of the staff points the staff. The last artifact and Sheogorath's main symbol of rulership is the Staff of Sheogorath, which freezes all foes in place. A lesser-known artifact of Sheogorath is the Folium Discognitum, a book that contains the collected insights of madmen; capable of giving the reader immense power and knowledge.[11]
Sheogorath is one of the easiest Daedric Princes to summon. Although his official summoning date is the second of Sun's Dawn, Sheogorath can be summoned any time there is a storm occurring,[12] or through an offering of a wolf or bear pelt. Another method of invocation is to leave an offering of yarn, lettuce and soul gems at his shrines in the mortal world.
Sheogorath savors the act of driving mortals insane and/or making them perform actions which can be seen as trivial or silly.[12] He is completely unpredictable, and often comments in nonsensical or otherwise socially unacceptable statements. He often refers to the removal of entrails and has a curious obsession with cheese, which is taken to near hysterical levels in Oblivion. Despite being completely mad, Sheogorath displays incredible intelligence and insight. He is invested in the affairs of Oblivion, as seen in being part of the compact of Sotha Sil in 2920 and his mention of attending the ""parties"" of the other Princes. He has also shown to be capable of not only manipulating mortals, but other Daedra Lords as well. Some famous cases include when he manipulated Malacath into killing his own son, defeated Hircine in a battle of beasts, and beat Vaermina at her own game.",Sheogorath,,,Breton,Male,,175212,175209

At the end of the Third Era, Sheogorath sent an invitation to Tamriel by way of a strange door in Niben Bay. The Madgod demanded a mortal Champion to face his foes. Throughout the course of the expansion, the Hero of Kvatch learns that Sheogorath is in fact Jyggalag, the Daedric Prince of Order. He tells the Hero that at the end of every era he becomes Jyggalag again, and lays waste to his own Realm. After the Champion eventually defeats Jyggalag, he explains that in ancient times he was one of the more powerful Daedra Lords. The influence of his sphere was so great that the other Daedric Princes grew jealous and feared him. They cursed him to live as Sheogorath, the incarnation of the thing he hated most.[5]
At the end of every Era, Jyggalag is allowed to take on his true form once again, and bring order to his realm, an event known as the Greymarch. After the Greymarch, however, he is transformed back into Sheogorath, who spreads madness upon the realm once more. The Champion can end this cycle by defeating Jyggalag during the Greymarch occurring at the end of the Third Era. This releases him from his curse, allowing him to remain in his true form instead of transforming back into Sheogorath. After defeating Jyggalag at the end of the expansion, the Champion is named the new Sheogorath.[6]
During the Fourth Era and Dragon Crisis, Sheogorath is ""on vacation"" in the mind of Pelagius Septim III and his absence from the Shivering Isles is felt by his servant Dervenin who asks the Last Dragonborn to convince the Mad God to return to the Isles. The Dragonborn finds themselves in Pelagius's mind and dressed in a Fine Hat and clothes. After introductions, and delivering Dervenian's request, Sheogorath explains to the Dragonborn that the only way to leave is to ""cure"" Pelagius's brain and tasks the Dragonborn to do so, and gives the hero the Wabbajack to help. After completing Sheogorath's tasks, Sheogorath agrees to leave and allowed the Dragonborn to keep the Wabbajack and clothes. He even asks that the Dragonborn ""look him up"" if they ever find themselves in the Shivering Isles. He even takes Dervenin with him back to Oblivion.[7]

Originally, Sheogorath was one of the Daedric Princes whom the Chimer, now Dunmer, revered in their ancient ancestral worship. However, when the Tribunal Temple became the dominating religion in Morrowind, Sheogorath—along with Mehrunes Dagon, Malacath, and Molag Bal—became known as one of the ""Four Corners of the House of Troubles.""[8] He was said to rebel against the Tribunal, and thus worship of Sheogorath became punishable by death. His role in Dunmer culture is to test them for any psychological weakness, and is associated with the fear other races have of the Dunmer.
When he rebelled against the Tribunal, Sheogorath tricked the moon Baar Dau, inspiring it to hurl itself at the city of Vivec. Sheogorath justified his actions by claiming Vivec was built in mockery of the heavens. Vivec is then said to have frozen Baar Dau in its descent, and the moon swore itself to the Tribunal's service forever. Today, the Tribunal Temple requires a pilgrimage to this moon, called the Shrine of Daring.
Sheogorath is one of the many prominent Daedric Princes in the culture of the Khajiit people. In the Khajiit myth of creation, Sheogorath is called ""Sheggorath."" He is known as the ""Skooma Cat"" in Elsweyr.
Sheoggorath was believed to have been born from the union of Ahnurr and Fadomai. He is an adversarial spirit that tests Khajiit on the Path by making them doubt the truth of their own thoughts, beliefs, and actions. He must be faced along the Path and be overcome before a Khajiit can visit Hermorah's library.[9] Some Khajiit tribes believe Sheggorath is dead and has been replaced by something Other.[10]
Sheogorath's status as a Daedric Prince and as a member of the ""Four Corners of the House of Troubles"" has made his mainstream worship largely taboo. Throughout Tamriel, however, there are small shrines where the devoted worship the madgod in secret. However, there is one holiday that is at least loosely related to Sheogorath. The second of Sun's Dawn is when Mad Pelagius day is celebrated. According to Gwinas, on this day there are great festivals and invocations at the shrines of Sheogorath.
There are six artifacts made by Sheogorath which are known on the mortal plane. The best-known of these is the staff known as Wabbajack. It can transform a creature into something else, turn them into piles of cheese, or instant death, though it is impossible to predict the result, much like Sheogorath himself. This artifact can be found in the games Daggerfall, Oblivion, Skyrim and Online, after doing tasks for Sheogorath, as part of certain quests. Another artifact is the Gambolpuddy glove, which fortifies half of the user's attributes while draining the other half. Gambolpuddy is seen in Morrowind, where it was found under a pillow in Ald Daedroth. His third artifact is the Fork of Horripilation, a fork which drains the user's magicka. It was given by the Statue of Sheogorath in Ihinipalit, in St. Delyn's Canton's Waterworks in Morrowind. The fourth artifact worth noting is the Staff of the Everscamp. This unique artifact in Oblivion summoned four Everscamps who could be neither banished nor killed. The fifth artifact of Sheogorath is the Spear of Bitter Mercy which can summon a Frost Atronach wherever the holder of the staff points the staff. The last artifact and Sheogorath's main symbol of rulership is the Staff of Sheogorath, which freezes all foes in place. A lesser-known artifact of Sheogorath is the Folium Discognitum, a book that contains the collected insights of madmen; capable of giving the reader immense power and knowledge.[11]
Sheogorath is one of the easiest Daedric Princes to summon. Although his official summoning date is the second of Sun's Dawn, Sheogorath can be summoned any time there is a storm occurring,[12] or through an offering of a wolf or bear pelt. Another method of invocation is to leave an offering of yarn, lettuce and soul gems at his shrines in the mortal world.
Sheogorath savors the act of driving mortals insane and/or making them perform actions which can be seen as trivial or silly.[12] He is completely unpredictable, and often comments in nonsensical or otherwise socially unacceptable statements. He often refers to the removal of entrails and has a curious obsession with cheese, which is taken to near hysterical levels in Oblivion. Despite being completely mad, Sheogorath displays incredible intelligence and insight. He is invested in the affairs of Oblivion, as seen in being part of the compact of Sotha Sil in 2920 and his mention of attending the ""parties"" of the other Princes. He has also shown to be capable of not only manipulating mortals, but other Daedra Lords as well.

Sheogorath (in Daedric script, ) is the Daedric Prince of Madness. His realm in Oblivion is known as the Shivering Isles,[1] otherwise known as the Madhouse or ""The Asylums"" [UL 1]. It is separated into two distinct communities: Mania, the fantastic, colorful side, where art enthusiasts and insane revelers reside, and Dementia, the horrific, dark and ominous side, inhabited by those with the darker side of Sheogorath's blessings.[1] Sheogorath is attended by his Chamberlain Haskill and the Nobles of his realm, the Duke and Duchess of Mania and Dementia.[2] He is also the main antagonist in the Mages Guild questline in The Elder Scrolls Online.
Sheogorath is one of the few Daedric Princes whose creation may be linked to the change or destruction of an Aedra; others include Malacath and Meridia. Aldmeri creation stories attribute his creation to the removal of Lorkhan's ""divine spark."" In one of these myths, he is described as the ""Sithis-shaped hole"" of the world.[3] However, in an interview conducted by the Imperial Library, Haskill states this interpretation of the creation of Sheogorath may not be the case.[UL 2]

Dervenin has attempted to visit Sheogorath and request his return, but he refused. Dervenin retrieved Pelagius' Hip Bone in hopes of changing Sheogorath's mind, but he once again refused.[1] One follower of Sheogorath, a madwoman, thinks it unwise to disrupt Sheogorath's vacation.[2]
By 4E 201, Sheogorath had been absent from the Shivering Isles for many years.[1] Dervenin walks around Solitude in search of someone to help return him.[3]
Sheogorath has chosen to neglect his followers and his realm in favor of a vacation. He spends many years chatting with Pelagius III in the latter's own mind, repeatedly telling the same story about the Oblivion Crisis, which he claims he was a part of.[4] He refuses to let anyone disturb him, much to Dervenin's distress.
When the Dragonborn appears, Sheogorath is keen to remind them that he is an immortal and the Madgod and that they should tread carefully when addressing him. At the same time, he often gets sidetracked during conversation and even forgets at times what the Dragonborn is actually doing. Sheogorath describes his youth as involving narwhales, honey combs and babies' tears.[5]
Unlike previous appearances, Sheogorath wants someone cured of mental illness and instructs the Dragonborn to do just that for Pelagius III. He also makes a point of telling them they ""treated"" Pelagius and not simply ""fixed"" him. Sheogorath then expresses pride in Pelagius for finally being free of his illness, having believed that the late Emperor ""always had it in him.""[4]
Sheogorath has abandoned his people to go on vacation. Dervenin beseeches the Dragonborn to retrieve his master and gives them Pelagius' Hip Bone to accomplish this task. Once inside the mind of Pelagius III, the Dragonborn must cure his madness in order to convince Sheogorath to return to the Shivering Isles.
I've done it. I've fixed Pelagius' mind. ""Hmmmm... 'Fixed' is such a subjective term. I think 'treated' is far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an arrow in the face.

/wiki/Siddgeir,"Siddgeir is a Nord and the current Jarl of Falkreath in Skyrim.
Siddgeir took over the position as Jarl and replaced his uncle Dengeir of Stuhn. According to Dengeir, this was a plot of the Imperial Legion as his nephew had a good relationship with the Legion. However, when asked as to why he did so, Siddgeir says that he took over because his uncle was too old and frail to rule as a Jarl.
Siddgeir can be seen as being lazy or unmotivated, as he usually lets his steward, Nenya, do his work for him. He suggests that the Dragonborn becomes a Jarl as well, since according to him, Jarls are wealthy and powerful, but do not have to do anything at all. He may also appear to be condescending, showing a lack of regard towards the Dragonborn when spoken to.
If the city is taken by the Stormcloaks, Dengeir of Stuhn takes over again as a Jarl. Siddgeir can then be found in the Blue Palace along with the expatriated Jarls and Stewards of other captured cities.
Siddgeir believes the Dragonborn should provide him with a proper tribute before he can hire them for work. Thus he requires the Dragonborn to obtain Black-Briar Mead for him.
If the Dragonborn has befriended Siddgeir before this quest, he may be asked to cause a distraction so that the Dragonborn may infiltrate the embassy.
Siddgeir has been colluding with bandits in exchange for a cut of their raids. However, they have stopped giving him money. Consequently, he asks the Dragonborn to kill them. Any of the Jarls or their steward/stewardess can give these when asked for work. A Bounty Note will be given to the Dragonborn identifying the type and location of the bounty.
The Dragonborn can become a Thane of all the Holds in Skyrim. The standard formula for each hold is to complete a specific quest or objective for the Jarl and then help out a specific number of citizens within the hold (three in minor holds, five in major ones), either by doing quests, miscellaneous objectives, or helping out in some other way.
I got your letter. I'm Dragonborn (Player name) ""Ah, it's you. Yes, well, now we'll see if the stories about you are true.

Sigdis is a very powerful draugr. He carries the Gauldur Blackbow, which absorbs a level-dependent amount of points of magicka per hit. He also knows the Unrelenting Force and Disarm shouts, and he teleports when he has been hit a few times, as well as creating clones of himself to trick opponents into wasting their attacks. An easy way to tell which is the real Sigdis is to target them. The real Sigdis will show damage if he has been injured, where as the clones will always have full health. If a clone is attacked, it will automatically disappear. Alternatively, in the first battle Sigdis will not glow as much as the clones do, while in the second battle he will also wear a different helmet from them. When he dies, he will have the weapon Gauldur Blackbow, a Gauldur Amulet Fragment (stamina version), and a Writ of Sealing, along with some arrows and sometimes minor loot. As he and his clones use Unrelenting Force frequently, it is hard to use melee attacks on them. This can be slowed by the use of follower who can help with fighting the clones and detecting who the real Sigdis is.

/wiki/Sinding,"Sinding is a Nord werewolf imprisoned in the jail of Falkreath.
Upon speaking to Mathies, he explains that Sinding killed his daughter while in werewolf form. Sinding was in Falkreath because he was looking for a giant beast roaming the wilds around the village. If he killed this beast, the Daedric Lord Hircine would lift his curse.
During the quest, the Dragonborn receives the Ring of Hircine from Sinding, which causes the wearer to sporadically transform into a werewolf. When walking away from his cell, a glance backwards will show a werewolf ripping off the bars from the roof, and guards will ask the Dragonborn about him escaping upon leaving the barracks. Killing the transformed Sinding and taking his skin is necessary to obtain the Savior's Hide from Hircine and to remove the Ring of Hircine. Alternatively, Sinding can be spared and the hunters killed, which removes the curse from the Ring of Hircine and allows lycanthropes to use it to transform as many times as desired.
If spared, it seems Sinding is ultimately unable to control his beast blood. If the option to spare Sinding is taken, even if the Dragonborn turned around and killed him as well to complete the quest both ways, he can appear later in a random encounter as a hostile werewolf fighting a guard from the local hold.

Stenvar's skill specialties are Heavy Armor, Block, Two-Handed, and Archery.
He is quite skilled with two-handed weapons, which he mentions when the Dragonborn first meets him. His default equipment is Steel Armor, a Hunting Bow and Iron Arrows, and an Iron Greatsword. He is an excellent warrior, who is ideal to use due to his resiliency. He is also somewhat talkative, making a variety of remarks when visiting numerous locations throughout Skyrim.

His journal describes his ill-fated attempt at excavating the ruins, though he himself was undaunted by the tragedies. Inside, they found some Dwarven spiders that were disposed of easily, where afterwards he began taking them apart to research them.
According to Endrast's Journal, their camp was ambushed at night by the falmer. While everyone was trying to escape, Sulla delved deeper into the ruins. He would not leave without finding what he came for. Umana chased after him.
When Sulla is first encountered, he is in a discussion with Umana. She is trying to persuade him to leave the ruins. Sulla is now paranoid thinking Umana will betray him to take the glory for herself. They then begin to fight until one of them kills the other or until the Dragonborn intervenes.
His fighting tactics are simple. He uses destruction magic as his primary attack and will use his Lesser Ward to block hostile spells should they be employed against him. When he runs out of magicka, he engages in melee combat. If his health goes very low, he flees from combat and uses Fast Healing. When his health has recovered enough, he continues to fight.

/wiki/Sven,"Sven is a Nord bard in Skyrim who lives in Riverwood with his mother, Hilde. 
Sven can generally be found inside the Sleeping Giant Inn playing his lute, since he is a graduate from the Bards College.
Sven is competing with Faendal for the heart of Camilla Valerius and asks the Dragonborn to sway things in his favor.
It is possible to recruit Sven as a follower if the quest ""A Lovely Letter"" is finished in his favor. He can also be recruited into the Blades when the Dragonborn needs to recruit followers for Delphine, provided the Dragonborn is already Sven's friend and if they have killed Paarthurnax during the quest ""Paarthurnax.""
If Sven dies after siding with him during ""A Lovely Letter,"" a Letter of Inheritance will be received.
With the Hearthfire add-on installed, Sven can become a steward in one of the Dragonborn's homesteads.
Sven's primary skills are Alchemy, Enchanting, and Smithing. His secondary skills are Archery, One-Handed, and Two-Handed. His tertiary skills are Light Armor, Sneak, and Speechcraft.
He benefits from Light Armor slightly more than Heavy Armor, but the difference is not too significant as his skills with both are relatively low. Likewise, his skill in one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, and archery are all roughly on par with each other, and all relatively low.
Sven's level cap is 20, tying him with Roggi Knot-Beard for the lowest follower level cap in the game. Additionally, along with Roggi Knot-Beard and Adelaisa Vendicci, Sven is one of only three followers who has a civilian job class instead of a professional combat-oriented one. As a result, his health is somewhat lower than that of other followers, and his primary skills are non-combat related ones. Low level characters or those that rely on their followers in combat may find it difficult to use Sven, as he won't be as efficient in battle as other followers would.

Sybille has served the Jarls of Solitude for over twenty years.[1] She first served Torygg's father, Istlod, and has continued to serve his family since. She had a hand in raising Torygg when he was very young.
She has an ominous habit involving Solitude prisoners. According to Ahtar, she periodically takes a ""volunteer"" from the Castle Dour Dungeon. Melaran makes reference to this as well, noting that one does well to avoid being thrown in the dungeons when she is on a ""bad day"" as the headsman's axe ""...may not be the worst way that Solitude Jail prisoners die"". While it is left unsaid, it stands to reason that this is her method of feeding.
Like other quest characters, raising her disposition by performing favors for her, Sybille begins to act noticeably kinder towards them, occasionally flirting and offering less harsh dialogue, such as asking, ""What do you need, handsome?"" and bidding them farewell with, ""It's been a pleasure.""
She is relatively insignificant and is not connected to any quests save for the order to eradicate a vampire lair.
If Sybille is killed somehow, she is replaced by Melaran as Court Wizard. Sometimes, he comments on the Dragonborn's involvement in her replacement.
After downloading The Elder Scrolls V: Dawnguard, her appearance changes slightly to match the new textures of vampires; this can be seen by looking at her eyes.

Her parents, Verner Rock-Chucker and Annekke Crag-Jumper, run the mining settlement Darkwater Crossing, northwest of Shor's Stone. According to dialogue, she exchanges letters with them as often as she can.
Sylgja explains that she recently injured herself in the mine, and thus cannot deliver her letters to her father in Darkwater Crossing. She asks the Dragonborn to bring the letters to him on her behalf. She promises a reward to them, and suggests that her father will probably have something for the Dragonborn to bring back. She will give the Dragonborn a leveled unenchanted jewelry piece as reward for bringing both letters back and forth.
After the Dragonborn has delivered her satchel to her father, she becomes a candidate for marriage.

/wiki/Taarie_(Skyrim),"Taarie is an Altmer in Skyrim who runs the Radiant Raiment with her sister Endarie in Solitude. After completing the quest ""Fit for a Jarl"" and investing in her shop, she becomes a candidate for marriage as well as the only Altmer candidate.
Like many Altmer, Taarie comes off as rude, impolite and a bit arrogant when the Dragonborn talks to her, and often insults them. However, as is suggested through a speech dialogue, Taarie is not intentionally insulting, regarding herself as being honest and forthright. However, overheard conversations with Endarie indicate that she is somewhat more caring for her customers than her sister.[1] If she is married, her dialogue becomes much friendlier though she will retain some haughty aspects.
Should the Dragonborn kill Taarie, hired thugs bearing a contract from Endarie will attack claiming that the Dragonborn must pay for killing her sister.
Taarie is also an Imperial loyalist and regards the Stormcloaks as traitors, a view she will express if talked to during Roggvir's execution. She will have very little sympathy for Roggvir, wanting to see him executed for treason and expressing a belief that his death should have been slower and more drawn out.
Upon his or her first visit to the Blue Palace, she may ask for the Dragonborn to wear an outfit tailored by her thus starting the radiant quest ""Fit for a Jarl."" She rewards the Dragonborn with the tailored outfit, Radiant Raiment fine clothes (which can be enchanted) and a leveled amount of gold.
Upon completing the ""Fit for a Jarl"" radiant quest and investing in her store, Taarie becomes a marriage option. When married, Taarie ""opens a shop,"" and gives the Dragonborn a profit of 100  each day; every day the profits are not collected, they accumulate. Her dialogue will become much more welcoming and she will no longer comment negatively on the Dragonborn's outfit.
If the Dragonborn marries Taarie and uses the Radiant Raiment as a home, her sister Endarie will still continue to suspiciously follow the Dragonborn everywhere in the store. After the marriage, everything in Radiant Raiment will be marked as owned by the Dragonborn and free to take. However, Endarie will still call the guards (who will show up for arrest) if the Dragonborn is seen picking the lock on the lockbox.
Taarie and Endarie sleep together in a twin bed, despite having two other single beds available. This occurs even after marriage, requiring the Dragonborn to wake Endarie and quickly activate a sleep cycle (to gain Lover's Comfort from Taarie) before she lies down again.
Like most spouses, she will comment on the city currently being lived in and how it is good for the children, if any. Taarie also has unique dialogue if asked for a Homecooked Meal.",Taarie,Female Elf Haughty,FemaleElfHaughty,High Elf,Female,,104620,78507

Tacitus is an admitted failure at smithing and can only produce nails, and even those are of questionable quality, much to Ghorza's frustration. When running the forge, he is shown to be very unconfident with his abilities, which is possibly the reason why he can only produce nails, despite Ghorza's teaching.
Even through his repeated failures, Tacitus seems to show a willingness to continue practicing his abilities.
Because of Tacitus' failures, the Dragonborn is tasked with a miscellaneous quest to obtain a copy of The Last Scabbard of Akrash.

These drinks are custom creations that he first devised in Gideon before moving to Skyrim. On his person, he carries a flagon of Velvet LeChance, White-Gold Tower and Cliff Racer. All three beverages can be purchased from him. He has a strong hatred for the Thieves Guild, calling them ""vermin"" and ""trash."" If caught stealing in the Bee and Barb, Talen-Jei will hire thugs in numbers from two to three to kill the Dragonborn. Proof of this is when killing the thugs' assumed leader, his loot will contain a contract signed by Talen-Jei.
He asks the Dragonborn to help him craft an Argonian wedding ring, by retrieving three flawless amethysts. The reward is a random non-leveled potion, weak poison or 200 , with the monetary reward usually being the highest valued of the three.
Unless one has an extremely generous disposition towards Talen-Jei and Keerava, the quest reward represents a major waste of the Dragonborn's time and money; three flawless amethysts (at base value) would be worth 540  when sold to a shop as is, or 665  if two are crafted into a gold jeweled necklace first.
In order to join the Thieves Guild, Brynjolf employs the Dragonborn with collecting debts the citizens of Riften have with the guild. Talen-Jei's lover, Keerava, is one such person. The Dragonborn can choose to approach him about her debt, to which he recommends threatening Keerava with the knowledge that her family resides in Morrowind.

In battle, she usually Dual Wields Sparks, but she will occasionally cast Conjure Flame Atronach, Conjure Frost Atronach, or Conjure Storm Atronach. She can summon multiple Atronachs at a single time and can teleport across the room. Followers wielding bows or spells can compensate for these tactics.

A battle can be avoided via persuasion, allowing the Dragonborn to take the books and leave. However, this prevents them from receiving the ""Fellglow Ritual Chamber Key"" needed to unlock the door to Fellglow Ritual Chamber behind her.
It can also be avoided by agreeing to hand over Orthorn. With a high Sneak level, one can then approach her from behind and kill her.
If Orthorn is told to get to safety and that he is not needed, she can be persuaded, the books taken and then sneak-attacked from behind to get the key.

When Ancano is defeated, Tolfdir becomes Master Wizard of the College, succeeding Mirabelle Ervine following her death at the hands of the Thalmor agent.
As well as offering Master-level training in Alteration, Tolfdir sells Alteration-based items such as jewelry, staves, spell tomes, and mage robes. When not teaching in the Hall of the Elements, Tolfdir may be found sleeping or eating on the lower level of the Hall of Attainment.

Despite his age and apparently absent-minded nature, Tolfdir is a very powerful mage; Mirabelle Ervine describes him as a preeminent scholar on Alteration and one of the best in Tamriel. He is never boastful, nor does he abuse his influence at the college, and is always glad to pass on his knowledge.
During the Dragonborn's first lessons at the college, Tolfdir instructs the apprentices about the proper use of wards. He also provides a lesser ward spell, free of charge, if it isn't already known. Thereafter, he serves as a master-level trainer for Alteration, staying in the Hall of the Elements and studying the Eye of Magnus while it is there.

/wiki/Torygg,"High King Torygg was the Jarl of Solitude and High King of Skyrim until his death at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak in 4E 201. He was the husband of Jarl Elisif, the current Jarl of Solitude.
Before his ascension to the throne, Torygg's father, Istlod, was High King for nearly twenty-five years. Upon Istlod's death, the Moot elected Torygg High King of Skyrim. Torygg was said by some to have a close connection with the Empire,[1] and praised them frequently,[2] others claim that he sympathized with the Stormcloaks and would have seceded from the Empire if Ulfric Stormcloak had merely asked.[3] Torygg, however, was crowned High King after the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, meaning Talos worship in Skyrim was banned to avoid retaliation from the Aldmeri Dominion.[4][3] High King Torygg would reign over Skyrim until his death at the hands of Ulfric Stormcloak, in 4E 201.[3][4] Since he was never publicly vocal regarding the controversy of the White-Gold Concordat, no one knew his true political views and those closest to him described his political leanings as complicated. Even so, many interpreted his silence during the signing of the White-Gold Concordat and its subsequent enforcement as alleged contentment of its policies and resented him for it.[5]
In 4E 201, Torygg was slain by Ulfric Stormcloak, Jarl of Windhelm, in a challenge over the leadership of Skyrim. Torygg was honor-bound to accept this and agreed to the challenge, but was completely unprepared for Ulfric's Unrelenting Force Shout. Opinions on what transpired differ greatly, however.
According to Ulfric, he used the power of the Thu'um to shout Torygg to the ground and then finished him with his sword[4] in front of the entire court.[3] Others, Torygg included,[6] say he was shouted to pieces by Ulfric's Thu'um.[7][3][8][9][10] Ulfric and his supporters maintain that it was a formal one-on-one duel in the ""Old Nord Way"" and thus should not be considered murder,[11] whereas others in Skyrim believe it was murder.[12]
Torygg was married to Elisif the Fair, who took up the position of Jarl of Solitude after his death. The position of High King is still in dispute and awaits the Moot's decision as Elisif and Ulfric vie for the position due to the Skyrim Civil War.
Through dialogue with his former court members and Elisif, the Dragonborn discovers he respected Ulfric Stormcloak. Sybille Stentor even states that Torygg might have stood up against the Empire if Ulfric had asked him to. Even so, although Torygg respected Ulfric's call for independence during the Moot to name Torygg High King, it was unlikely he would have led Skyrim to secede from the Empire since he feared Skyrim could not defeat the Third Aldmeri Dominion alone and did not want to see the Empire Tiber Septim built fall apart.[3] After his death, he is still respected by Imperial loyalists. To Stormcloaks and proud Talos worshippers however, Torygg is viewed as a puppet king of the Empire who betrayed them for the Empire's good graces and money.[13] They celebrate Torygg's death in the duel against Ulfric Stormcloak as a symbol of rebellion against what they consider the corruption of the Empire and the Thalmor.[5]
Torygg makes a minor appearance in Sovngarde at the end of the main quest line. Here, the Dragonborn can briefly speak to him, where he tells them that he faced Ulfric knowing that he would most certainly die but maintains that his honor at least is unstained.

/wiki/Ulfric_Stormcloak_(Skyrim),"Ulfric Stormcloak, known by some as the Bear of Markarth,[1] is the Jarl of Windhelm and leader of the Stormcloak rebellion. Ulfric supports Skyrim's independence from the Empire, which he believes has been corrupted by the Aldmeri Dominion and too weak to protect its citizens.[2] Some describe Ulfric as a hero,[3] while others label him an opportunist.[4]
A veteran of the Great War, Ulfric's holds deep resentment of the White-Gold Concordat between the Empire and Aldmeri Dominion, particularly the ban of Talos worship. During the Markarth Incident, Ulfric marched soldiers into Markarth under the pretext that this action would re-legitimize Talos worship, but was eventually detained.[1]
He is first seen bound and gagged, accompanying the Dragonborn and a few other prisoners of war while traveling to Helgen for their execution.[5]
As a boy, Ulfric was chosen by the Greybeards to study with them at High Hrothgar. He trained with them for almost ten years and developed his skills in the Way of the Voice. He was to become a Greybeard himself, but his life took a different path when the Great War began in 4E 171.[2] Ulfric felt compelled to help the war effort and left High Hrothgar to join the Imperial Legion,[6] much to the disdain of Arngeir, who believed that the Way of the Voice should only be used for the worship of Kynareth.[2]
During the Great War, he fought alongside Galmar Stone-Fist and Legate Rikke;[7] however, he was captured by the Aldmeri Dominion during the Dominion's campaign for the Imperial City.[6]
While imprisoned, he was interrogated by Elenwen for information, under which they learned of his potential value (being the son of the Jarl of Windhelm), and considered him an asset to their influence in Skyrim. He was made to believe information obtained during his interrogation was crucial in the capture of the Imperial City in Cyrodiil, even though it had fallen before any information could be gained.[6] The Thalmor Dossier on Ulfric says he was then allowed to escape; whether he escaped on his own and the Thalmor were unable to apprehend him or if he was intentionally set free is not known.
In 4E 175, the Great War ended with the Empire signing the White-Gold Concordat, an act which banned the worship of Talos in the Empire.[8] During the war, the Nords lost possession of the Reach due to an uprising by a group of Bretons known as Reachmen.[1]
Igmund, son of the previous Jarl of the Reach, stated his family and their Imperial colleagues[9] sought help from Ulfric in ousting the Reachmen invaders. Igmund's father, Hrolfdir, promised Ulfric that if he re-took the Reach, then Hrolfdir as Jarl would allow free worship of Talos in Markarth again. Ulfric agreed and marched his militia to the gates of Markarth and retook the city, supposedly using the power of his Thu'um.[1]
The leader of the Reachmen, Madanach, was captured, but was spared by prominent Markarth citizen Thonar Silver-Blood, as he was deemed more valuable alive than dead, and was incarcerated in Cidhna Mine.[10] The surviving Reachmen fled to the hills of the Reach and became known as the Forsworn. As a result of the battle, later known as the Markarth Incident, Ulfric stationed a Nordic militia in the area to aid in keeping the Forsworn that had retreated from retaking Markarth. Hrolfdir initially kept his promise to Ulfric and allowed free worship of Talos for a time.[1]
When the Imperial Legion arrived to restore the rule of law, Ulfric allegedly refused them entry into the city until they also agreed free worship of Talos would be allowed. With chaos supposedly running through the streets of Markarth and the reports of deaths rising every day, the Empire had no choice but to grant Ulfric and his men their worship, thus jeopardizing the peace agreement with the Aldmeri Dominion.[1] Igmund however, implies that the Empire simply hoped that the Dominion wouldn't find out about the free Talos worship, and when they eventually did, scapegoated Ulfric and his militia in order to avoid incrimination and prevent a potential second Great War with the Dominion.[11]
Eventually, the Empire rescinded the agreement due to pressure from the Aldmeri Dominion, and Ulfric and his militia were expelled from the city and imprisoned shortly after with Hrolfdir's help. This betrayal left Ulfric bitter towards the Empire and is considered to be the initial conception of the Stormcloak rebellion.[1][9]
His father Hoag,[12] the Jarl of Windhelm, usually referred simply as ""The Bear of Eastmarch,"" died during his incarceration. Ulfric, his only son, was forced to deliver his eulogy via a letter that he had smuggled out of prison. Leaving prison, Ulfric returned to Windhelm to find the city in mourning. The citizens were said to have been calling out for justice and war against the Aldmeri Dominion. Naturally, they sat Ulfric on the throne and he became Jarl.[2]
After the death of High King Istlod, the Moot convened to elect a new king. During this Moot, Ulfric continually spoke about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason. Eventually, the Moot had elected Istlod's son, Torygg, as the new High King of Skyrim.[13]
In 4E 201, after years of brewing resentment for what he and his followers considered the Empire's betrayal of Skyrim after the Markarth Incident, Ulfric challenged High King Torygg to a duel. Ulfric maintains it was to show how weak Skyrim had become under Imperial rule. He also claims that it was a challenge of rule in the ""Old Nord Way"" and that Torygg accepted the challenge.[2] Others in Skyrim, such as General Tullius, denounced the act as murder and an attempt to usurp the throne.[14]
After Torygg's death, Ulfric fled back to Windhelm. Some time after this event, the Imperial Legion managed to ambush Ulfric at Darkwater Crossing in order to capture him. The ambush was successful and Ulfric surrendered himself without a fight.[15]
Much of Stormcloak doctrine stems from Ulfric's views that Skyrim should secede from what he considers a corrupt crumbling Empire; one that already is defeated by the Thalmor. After witnessing the deaths of an untold number of Nords who sacrificed themselves during The Great War, Ulfric considered the White-Gold Concordat treaty between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion to be a complete betrayal of the Empire's citizens.[2]
Ulfric also seeks to become the next High King, as he believes there has not been a ""true"" High King in Skyrim for generations, and that previous kings were puppets that were hand-picked by the Emperor.[2] Some Nords feel that his opposition to the White-Gold Concordat and the banning of Talos worship in Skyrim is simply a façade for him to gain more supporters to gain his true goal of becoming High King of Skyrim.[16] Asking Ulfric how he became Jarl of Eastmarch, however, will reveal that he is very dedicated in following the ways of traditional Nord beliefs. He says that the throne he sits on is Ysgramor's and his father's, rather than his, and that he only hopes he can do both of them proud.[2]
Furthermore, Ulfric's dialogue with Galmar Stone-Fist reveals that he does not relish the lives that will be lost in his rebellion and is considerate of the Nord families who will lose loved ones in his civil war. Even so, Ulfric feels he must see his quest for Skyrim's independence to its final conclusion as he sees the Empire as an inept parasite that continues to bleed Skyrim dry to recoup their losses from the Great War that they chose to surrender in. He also sees the Empire as an obstacle which is preventing his people from ridding his homeland of Thalmor influence. In addition to his qualms about how the Empire's politics are affecting his homeland, he also resents the Empire for what he sees as unjustly criminalizing the Nord people for desiring to rule themselves and disregarding the sacrifices of all the soldiers who fought in the Great War by appeasing the oppressive demands of the Aldmeri Dominion.[17]
With several of his policies being nationalistic in tone, many non-Nord and some Nords consider Ulfric to be prejudiced. He is believed by some to have sequestered the Dunmer population in Windhelm to the slums of the Gray Quarter[18] and the Argonians to the assemblage off the docks, issuing a decree forbidding the Argonians from living within the city's walls,[19] contrary to his father Hoag's[12] more ""soft"" policy,[20] however this hostile belief toward outsiders is shared by much of Windhelm's populace.[18] Dialogue with Niranye—an Altmer who lives within the city—actually suggests that it is the Dunmer who chose to live in the Gray Quarter due to being ""too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are.""[21] Similar comments are made by Belyn Hlaalu, a Dunmer who owns property in Windhelm.[22]
Pleas from Dunmer citizens often fall on deaf ears, leading them to believe he has nothing but disdain for them. Some even claim Ulfric refuses to send aid to the Khajiit caravans and non-Nord towns that have been raided by bandits.[18] Dialogue shared between Ulfric and his steward Jorleif indicate, however, that he does not attend to the issues in his city because he is too preoccupied with the Stormcloak Rebellion and the greater issues of Skyrim to worry about them, saying it is the guards' jobs to deal with such issues.[23] He also allows non-Nords to live peacefully in Windhelm and own businesses, including Altmer and Imperials.

In the past, Uthgerd attempted to join The Companions, but accidentally killed the boy she was set against. Thus, she was not accepted into the Companions, and bears a grudge against them which the Dragonborn can ask about.
She challenges the Dragonborn to a brawl with a wager of 100 . If the Dragonborn wins, Uthgerd pays the money wagered and becomes a potential follower, marriage partner, and possible steward.
The brawl itself is fairly easy, regardless of character class and can be completed successfully at lower levels to earn the bonus money.
As a follower, Uthgerd is an extremely capable fighter, wearing heavy armor and wielding two-handed weapons and bows. Her default equipment includes a steel greatsword and a set of steel plate armor, with the exception of a helmet. She wears any helmets given to her. Due to her heavy armor and two-handed great sword, she excels at close range melee combat.
Uthgerd the Unbroken is a potential recruit for the Blades.
She is a loyal follower, but only to a point. She will not steal for the Dragonborn, and if an innocent civilian is murdered, Uthgerd immediately attacks and will not relent until one or the other dies.
If an Amulet of Mara is equipped, the Dragonborn can marry Uthgerd. She can be both a follower and a spouse simultaneously.
The Dragonborn can also buy things from, and sell things to, Uthgerd, but if she is also acting as a follower, she instead tries to sell the items traded with her back to the Dragonborn and does not offer her original wares.
After the wedding ceremony, if she goes back to wearing her default armor, despite having upgraded armor given to her prior to the wedding, wait a day or so and she will begin wearing the better armor, and the steel plate armor can be purchased from her.
Uthgerd can become a steward for one of the newly constructed homes if the Hearthfire DLC has been installed.
If Uthgerd dies, the Dragonborn receives an inheritance of 100–400 , minus the Jarl's tax. Her coffin will appear in Whiterun's Hall of the Dead.
Uthgerd the Unbroken's primary skills are One-Handed and Heavy Armor. Her secondary skills are Block and Archery, and her tertiary skill is Two-Handed.
Although Uthgerd starts out with a two-handed steel greatsword, her skill with two-handed weapons is only fair; instead, she is most skilled with one-handed weapons. She fights best using either a one-handed weapon/shield combo, or dual-wielding one-handed weapons combined with strong Heavy Armor to make up for the lack of a shield.

Vaermina is often said to be strongly connected with Magnus, the source of magic on Tamriel. Many scholars believe that, through their dreams, even otherwise magically-untalented mortals can slip into Quagmire, and behold Vaermina's presence. Upon speaking to her, Vaermina will explain that mortals visit her constantly in their nightmares, speak to her in their sleep, and often wake in a cold sweat upon leaving her presence. Most mortals are unaware of this meeting, however, as they cannot remember anything that occurred during their dreams. After a true, remembered encounter with the Daedric Lord, her followers often claim that nothing on Nirn holds any fear for them, as nothing can possibly be as frightening as being in Vaermina's presence.
Vaermina does not appear much in the lore of Tamriel, with one notable exception. When seeking a cure for vampirism on Vvardenfell, in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Vaermina is named as the source of Molag Bal's information on how to cure the disease.
During Vaermina's quest, the player gets a first-hand look at her penchant for psychological terror. To even speak to the Daedra, you must present a Black Soul Gem, a device whose purpose is to trap the soul of a sentient creature. You are then tasked with retrieving an artifact stolen from Vaermina by a wizard.
When you track down the wizard's hideout, you enter a nightmare world full of lesser daedra and bizarre, otherworldly scenery. Some portions of the wizard's tower resemble the Deadlands, including the ever-present lava and claw-like bridges. Vaermina's final warning to you strongly implies that she, not the wizard, is responsible for the state of the tower. The wizard himself is found comatose, nearby Vaermina's precious Orb. Upon returning her artifact, the Daedra tells you that the wizard will be trapped in his nightmare forever, as punishment for his theft.
Vaermina rewards you with the Skull of Corruption, a staff capable of creating a nightmare double of any humanoid creature, which automatically attacks the original being with a vengeance.
In the town of Dawnstar, the Dragonborn will encounter—either inside the inn or just outside of it—a couple of citizens speaking with a robed man, speaking to them about their horrific nightmares. The man, named Erandur, seems to know something about the situation, but will not fully explain what it is when he's approached by the Dragonborn. The man claims to be a Priest of Mara, and that he can indeed remedy the situation, but is in need the Dragonborn's help.
He then leads the Dragonborn to a tower overlooking the town. Upon reaching the tower, the priest explains that the tower used to be a shrine dedicated to Vaermina. Long ago, a band of Orcs invaded the tower and had a bloody conflict with all those dwelling inside. As a last-ditch effort to prevent the Orcs from seizing the inner sanctum in which the Skull of Corruption stands, the priests released the Miasma, a gas which instantly puts all those who inhale it into an unbreakable deep hibernation, while also keeping those slumbering perfectly preserved.
Unfortunately, the longer one stays asleep under the Miasma's influence, the more their mind breaks down. As such, upon entering the tower and breaking the air-tight seal, the Miasma recedes, allowing the Orcs and priests to awaken and begin attacking in a frenzy. Upon entering the shrine, the priest explains to the Dragonborn how the Skull of Corruption is the source of everyone's nightmares, since it devours dreams and memories for Vaermina to collect.
Along the way to the inner sanctum, the Dragonborn must drink a special potion called Vaermina's Torpor in order to get past a magical barrier. This potion allows one to enter a state of being called ""The Dreamstride."" In theory, this allows someone to physically teleport across great distances. Any who drink it instantly fall asleep and enter a dream-like world of the memories from someone nearby. Where they are in the world during The Dreamstride when they wake up is where their physical body will be in the physical world. As such, the hero visits the memory of a Priest of Vaermina on the day that the Orcs invaded, allowing the hero to witness as this priest runs to the device that sets up the barrier and releases the Miasma. Upon doing this in the dream, the hero awakens in the physical world, looking at the barrier control device (a soul gem).
Having circumvented the barrier, the priest and the hero make their way into the inner sanctum where they find two of the priest's former companions. Upon defeating them and having the Skull within sight, Vaermina's disembodied voice speaks out, telling the Dragonborn that the priest is trying to deceive them, and that they should kill the priest and claim the staff for their own. If the priest is allowed to finish the ritual, he won't turn against the player, and he may be recruited as a companion. As a result, though, the Skull can not be obtained. Alternately, if he is killed by the Dragonborn, then the Skull of Corruption will be rewarded to them and count towards the Oblivion Walker achievement.

She is quite sure of her abilities as she tells the Dragonborn not even to think of replacing her and to follow whatever she says. Despite her behaviour alienating her from her counterparts, Vex is utterly loyal to the Guild and will react violently to any threat or insult to it; when Mercer Frey's betrayal is discovered, Vex immediately draws her dagger and vows to kill him personally for it.
The Dragonborn must break into Goldenglow Estate and raid the safe there, as well as light three bee hives on fire. Speaking to Vex will reveal that she had previously attempted to do the job with Delvin, but Aringoth, the estate's owner, had stationed eight mercenaries around the estate and Vex was wounded in the fight. She will then tell of a sewer entrance on the northwest part of the island, which will make breaking into the estate much easier and avoid the guards for the time being.

He is a supporter of the Stormcloaks and respected figure in the city, albeit not by Olfrid Battle-Born. If the Dragonborn sides with the Stormcloaks during the Civil War questline and conquers Whiterun, he will become the Jarl.
Vignar has a brother, Eorlund Gray-Mane, who is married to Fralia. He is the uncle of Avulstein, Olfina and Thorald Gray-Mane.
Vignar was a commander in the Imperial Legion for thirty years; he fought in the Great War. He says when the Empire signed the White-Gold Concordat, it shamed everyone. The Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns used to be friends, though that was until the Battle-Borns chose the Empire's side during the Civil war.
Vignar claims to have been a great warrior long ago and joined the Companions sometime in his youth. He seems to be the oldest member of The Companions; Kodlak suggests that he witnessed the rise and fall of about half a dozen Harbingers. Vilkas also mentions that he knows the Companions' history ""as well as Vignar by now,"" except he can actually remember it.
Of all the Gray-Manes, Vignar seems to be the one who is most opposed to the Battle-Borns, with both women in the family having lines about the two clan's feud's stupidity, and the other men not commenting.
Vignar Gray-Mane replaces Balgruuf the Greater as the Jarl of Whiterun, if the Dragonborn helps the Stormcloaks take over Whiterun in The Battle for Whiterun. He also mentions plans to build a Temple of Talos in Whiterun, and makes Heimskr the High Priest.

/wiki/Vilkas,"Vilkas is a Nord werewolf resident of Whiterun. He is the Master at Arms of the Companions[1] and a member of the Circle, the most formidable and experienced of their warriors. Like the rest of the Companions, he lives in Jorrvaskr in the Wind District of Whiterun. He is a Master-level trainer in two-handed weaponry and serves as the Dragonborn's shield-brother in several of the Companions' quests. He is also one of the Companions who can assign radiant quests to the Dragonborn.
Upon completion of the Companions' main plotline, Vilkas can be recruited as a follower and becomes a potential marriage candidate. He can be recruited into the Blades if the Dragonborn talks to Delphine while having him as a follower, or as a steward if the Hearthfire DLC has been installed.
Vilkas and his twin brother, Farkas, were both raised in Jorrvaskr by Jergen, who rescued them from a cult of necromancers.[1] It is unknown if he was their biological father. According to Vilkas, Jergen left to fight in the Great War but never returned.
Eventually, Vilkas and Farkas both officially joined the Companions and rose to the ranks of the Circle. They were said to be the youngest members to ever join, though this may be a play on words by Vignar Gray-Mane, referring to the twins' young age during their residence at Jorrvaskr rather than the age at which their membership became official.[2]
As Master at Arms, Vilkas is in charge of training the younger members in weapon combat. He has a reputation of being hard on his students but is an excellent teacher.[1]
At first, Vilkas seems to think the Dragonborn is not worthy of being a Companion. He does eventually warm up to the idea after the completion of ""Glory of the Dead.""
Vilkas is well-spoken, and considered to be an intelligent man by the other Companions, the counterpart to his brother's physical prowess. He, along with his brother and Kodlak, resists the call of the beast-blood, choosing instead to refrain from transformations. However, he struggles with the side-effects more harshly than the others.[3]
He resents Jergen leaving them, and looks down on his brother's rosy description of their childhood. He at first claims that it is the promise of coin that feeds his blade, but later admits his respect for what the Companions represent and upholding the legacy of Ysgramor. He has great respect for Kodlak and trusts his judgement, even when it disagrees with his own.
Vilkas is also thought of as a hot-tempered man.[4] For example, during ""Purity of Revenge,"" he does not hesitate to avenge Kodlak's death. However, he does later show remorse for his rash actions, as seen in ""Glory of the Dead,"" during which he refuses to enter the rest of Ysgramor's Tomb, feeling himself unworthy.
After the Companions' main questline is completed, Vilkas will eventually give the quest ""Purity."" In this quest, he will ask the Dragonborn to cure him of beast blood.
He wears a set of Wolf Armor minus the helmet, and carries a unique Skyforge steel sword and banded iron shield. After the quest ""Take Up Arms,"" he carries a Skyforge steel greatsword.
Before Take Up Arms and after ""Glory of the Dead,"" Vilkas can be randomly encountered in the wilds of Skyrim traveling with fellow Companion Ria.
When the Dragonborn first approaches Kodlak Whitemane to join the Companions, he and Vilkas are having a private conversation. Kodlak assigns Vilkas the task of testing the Dragonborn's skill. Vilkas escorts the Dragonborn to the training yard and endures a few swings, then tells the Dragonborn to deliver his sword to the Skyforge for sharpening.
In this radiant quest, Vilkas requires the Dragonborn to track down and kill an escaped prisoner in a specific hold.
This radiant quest requires the Dragonborn to retrieve a random weapon or item from a radiant dungeon and deliver it back to Vilkas for payment.
In this radiant quest, Vilkas requires the Dragonborn to rescue a kidnapped citizen and escort the citizen home safely.
After Vilkas informs the Dragonborn of Kodlak's death, he demands they accompany him to Driftshade Refuge to retrieve the Fragments of Wuuthrad and wipe out the Silver Hand once and for all. Once the mission is complete and the two have returned to Whiterun, he informs the Dragonborn that all the Companions are meeting at the Skyforge for Kodlak's funeral.
After Kodlak's funeral, Vilkas accompanies the remaining members of the Circle to The Underforge. When the Dragonborn enters, he and Aela are arguing about granting Kodlak's final wish. The decision is made for the Circle to travel to Ysgramor's Tomb and cure Kodlak's spirit of lycanthropy so he may ascend to Sovngarde.
Once the Circle arrives and the tomb is opened, Vilkas chooses not to proceed, due to his grief clouding his judgement and making him unworthy. He cautions the others on what to expect and waits next to the statue of Ysgramor outside the burial chamber. Once the quest is complete, Vilkas decides to stay at the tomb with the other Circle members for a while.
Vilkas wishes to rid himself of his beast blood. To cure him, the Dragonborn must take him to Ysgramor's Tomb, throw a Glenmoril Witch Head into the fire, and then kill Vilkas's beast spirit.",Vilkas,Male Nord,MaleNord,Nord,Male,,108181,108180

During waking hours, she works down at the East Empire Company Warehouse, outside of the Solitude walls. More specifically, her job is to manage the shipments of goods for the Company, standing watch in the customs office before the entrance to the warehouse.
She is the cousin of Emperor Titus Mede II, ruler of the Mede Dynasty and Third Empire. If the Dragonborn converses with her, she gushes about planning her upcoming wedding, and how, despite being the cousin of the Emperor, she has worked hard on her own to achieve her position at the East Empire Company.
If the Dragonborn does not join the Dark Brotherhood, Vittoria can be found wandering in or outside of Solitude. She can also be found in the East Empire Company customs office, near the entrance to the East Empire Company Warehouse; however, she never triggers any merchant dialogue.
If the Dragonborn becomes the Listener of the Dark Brotherhood, Astrid sends them to murder Vittoria at her wedding, to make the Emperor's visit to Skyrim a certainty as he'll take Vittoria's death as a hostile move to continue the Skyrim Civil War and ruin potential peace talks between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks, since now his own family was involved with her murder.
Speaking to Babette reveals that Vittoria will give a speech to her guests during the ceremony—and that killing her while she is speaking from the balcony is the preferred method of execution. The means of murder is unimportant; she can be killed by blade, arrow, spell, gargoyle, or by her groom (under the effect of a Frenzy spell). However Vittoria is killed, an additional reward of gold is given if the murder happens during her speech. Once the murder takes place, Veezara appears to protect the Dragonborn on their escape from the castle. Astrid sends him to ensure the Dragonborn survives the contract. Reactions to Vittoria's death from the gathered guests are varied, but both Vittoria's husband-to-be and mother are devastated by it.
She can be seen in the party, but rarely. She describes the party as a bore and that she only came because the East Empire Company and the Thalmor have ties together. With a high enough Speech skill, she can be persuaded to distract the guests.

He possesses knowledge about Dwemer artifacts, making comments on their trap-making skills whenever he enters Dwemer Ruins. Both he and Marcurio, another mercenary, share similar quotes and an expansive knowledge of the Dwemer.

If given the Boots of the Old Gods and heavy armor boots, he equips the Boots of the Old Gods. This is common with some other followers.

The orb is visible upon entry. A number of Falmer and Falmer Servants will be hostile and one must thus fight their way through them. After doing so, use Unrelenting Force on the orb. Doing so will make the orb ring and echo throughout the caverns. This will summon Vulthuryol.
If the Dragonborn summons Vulthuryol and does not engage in combat with him, he will eventually take up a stationary position on the ground outside of the south entrance to the orb complex.

If initiated in dialogue, he will often be asked to be left alone, as he is mourning the loss of his daughter, Lilija. 
As worshipers of Talos, Vulwulf and his wife became furious with the Empire when the White-Gold Concordat was signed. Thus, when Ulfric Stormcloak started the Civil War for Skyrim's independence, Vulwulf and his wife began supporting the Stormcloaks. Together with Nura, he had two sons, Asgeir Snow-Shod and Unmid Snow-Shod, and a daughter named Lilija. Much to his content, the oldest son, Unmid, became a housecarl to the Jarl of Riften, and his daughter, Lilija, joined the Stormcloaks as a healer. However, she had died a few months later, despite being a non-combatant. Vulwulf mourns her death deeply, and it has caused him to become bitter, acting highly aggressive towards anyone he suspects of being an Imperial sympathizer.
Vulwulf is a possible target needed to be intimidated by initiating a brawl.
When offered The Warmth of Mara, Vulwulf would respond with doubt in Mara, stating that she is not doing anything about the war, in which hundreds of Stormcloak soldiers die in for no good reason.
Vulwulf appears at the wedding ceremony of his son Asgeir and his fiancée Vittoria Vici.

/wiki/Wuunferth_the_Unliving,"Wuunferth the Unliving Wuunferth the Unliving is an elderly mage serving as the court-wizard for Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak. He also teaches Adept-level Destruction magic.
Wuunferth resides in the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm. He has a room at the end of the hall on the second floor – the first door on the left when entering the Palace of the Kings – which has an arcane enchanter and alchemy lab. If accused of crimes during ""Blood on the Ice,"" he will be moved to the jail of the Windhelm Barracks, known as the Bloodworks. After being exonerated, he will return to his normal duties.
In addition to being a member of the College of Winterhold, Wuunferth the Unliving is aware of the nature of the Necromancer's Amulet, apparently knowing it ""well.""[1] He has never kept a journal, even for study,[1] a fact which supports his innocence.[2] Wuunferth has been investigating ""the Butcher's"" murders for some time before the Dragonborn, to which he has noted a pattern to the killings,[1] although without the Dragonborn's help, he is unable to know exactly what this means.[2] Calixto Corrium claims that he dabbles in Necromancy,[3] and Viola Giordano will note that rumors have circled around him for years.[4] Wuunferth will later rebuke this, saying that he in ""good standing"" at the College, and that they have banned Necromancy for centuries.[1]
As a court mage, Wuunferth expresses heavy interest in magic, unlike the rest of the Stormcloaks in Windhelm, and, unlike someone more physically-inclined, Wuunferth believes that magic is the ""true power"" of the world and that brains are better than brawn.[1] Viola Giordano regards him as a ""dangerous man,"" supporting his title as ""the unliving.""[4] He appears somewhat arrogant in this regard, claiming that everything said about him is ""probably true"" and that most of his research would confuse the Dragonborn.[1] He also acts spiteful when he is turned against, proclaiming that the city has ""lost their brains"" and that it ""isn't over"" to Jorleif when arrested.[2] Despite this hostility, though, Wuunferth is loyal to Windhelm and Ulfric Stormcloak. He is willing to do favors to Ulfric without hesitation,[1] and is actively investigating the murder spree of the Butcher while the city guard are preoccupied with the war.[2] He puts aside his previous grievances with the Dragonborn to do this, showing that his spite does not blind him to his duties, and that he is willing to move on in order to save the people of Windhelm.[2]
It is possible that Wuunferth is the target of a radiant quest for the Companions. Farkas asks the Dragonborn to intimidate a citizen of Skyrim. It is the Dragonborn's duty to track down the person of interest and ""rough them up"" by initiating a bare-knuckle fight with them until they yield; killing the target while on the job will result in failure, although since Wuunferth is essential, this is impossible without console commands. Returning to Farkas completes the quest.
An initial investigation leads the Dragonborn to believe that Wuunferth the Unliving is the Butcher responsible for the killings on advice from both Viola Giordano and Calixto Corrium. He can be reported to Jorleif as such, to which he will then be imprisoned; the quest will end, with the Butcher seemingly caught. After this, though, murders continue, proving that he was innocent after all, and that he was in fact framed by Calixto. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can accuse him of Necromancy directly, to which the truth will come out that he was in fact investigating the murders himself. Regardless, he will tell that the Strange Amulet was in fact the Necromancer's Amulet, and that there appears to be a ritual at play. He will then instruct the Dragonborn to survey the Stone Quarter, where he predicts a new murder will take place.
I've heard you dabble in necromancy. ""I beg your pardon? Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing! They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!""

/wiki/Ysolda,"Ysolda is a Nord found in Whiterun, usually near Dragonsreach and the marketplace. After the Dragonborn has given Ysolda a mammoth tusk for ""Rare Gifts,"" she becomes a candidate for marriage.
Ysolda comes across as a bargain hunter and keen tradeswoman, yet her personality seems quite friendly if a bit nosy. Most of her interactions with other characters are friendly, while at other times she will exchange a few hostile words.
Ysolda asks the Dragonborn to find her a Mammoth Tusk, which she needs to give to a Khajiit caravaneer. Doing so will increase Speech. However, if the Dragonborn's Speech level is already 100, the quest can be completed but with no real reward. Though the tusk is supposed to be given to a Khajiit caravaneer, she does not appear to ever relinquish it, and it can be reacquired later in the game. She will even accept a stolen tusk, such as one from Jorrvaskr.
Ysolda can be involved in the quest ""A Night to Remember,"" and is one of the possible characters that gives the Dragonborn the wedding ring. This can still occur if the Dragonborn is married to her, and she does not have any problem letting the Dragonborn borrow her wedding ring for someone else. Due to Radiant A.I., this will not always be the case. After completing the quest, it may be difficult to find Ysolda. She will usually turn up at the Temple of Mara in Riften if the Dragonborn continues searching.
Ysolda can also be involved in The Companions quest ""Rescue Mission,"" and is one of the possible characters that the Dragonborn must rescue.
If the Dragonborn travels to Sleeping Tree Camp and enters Sleeping Tree Cave, Ulag will have a note from Ysolda about Sleeping Tree Sap. Married or not, the Dragonborn can confront her about it.

/wiki/Arch-Curate_Vyrthur,"Arch-Curate Vyrthur is one of the last living Snow Elves, alongside his brother Knight-Paladin Gelebor, and is the secondary antagonist of the Dawnguard storyline. He is also a vampire, and believes that Auri-El is to blame for allowing him to turn after becoming infected.
Sometime in the late Merethic Era, Vyrthur served as the Arch-Curate within the Chantry of Auri-El. During this time he was turned into a Vampire by one of the initiates of the Chantry.
He believed that Auri-El, the Snow Elves' primary deity, betrayed him by not providing him with any protection against disease. In an act of revenge for allowing him to become inflicted with vampirism, Vyrthur created the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy, the fulfillment of which would weaken Auri-El's overall influence on Nirn and provide him some measure of personal satisfaction for his suffering. All that was needed to fulfill this prophecy was the blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour and Auriel's Bow.
During the First Era, the Chantry of Auri-El was attacked by the twisted remnants of his extinct race - the Falmer. Several stormed the Inner Sanctum, but Vyrthur evidently defeated the intruders, freezing them solid within casings of ice.[1][2]
In order to obtain Auriel's Bow, the Dragonborn is tasked by Knight-Paladin Gelebor to fill the Initiate's Ewer at five of Auriel's Wayshrines, in order to unlock the Inner Sanctum where Vyrthur awaits with the bow in his possession.
After entering Auriel's Chapel, he can be found seated on a throne behind a magical wall of ice. Approaching him will begin a short dialogue, admitting that he has been waiting all this time for someone to bring the final component to him, namely Serana. Afterwards, he unleashes swarms of frozen Falmer and Chaurus upon the Dragonborn and Serana.
Once the swarms have been defeated, Vyrthur will destroy the entire roof of the chapel in a fit of rage and retreat out to a grand balcony overlooking the Forgotten Vale. He is promptly defeated by the Dragonborn and Serana, leaving his brother Gelebor as the only known Snow Elf.
In battle, he uses ice magic. Spells such as Icy Spear and Frost Cloak, in addition to a unique variant of Vampiric Drain that also drains stamina, make up the core of his arsenal. He also typically summons a Frost Atronach at the start of the battle. Once his magicka runs out, he switches to his frost-enchanted Elven Dagger.
It is possible to defeat him very quickly and easily when using the full Unrelenting Force shout to blow him off the grand balcony, causing him to fall to his death. However, the armor he wears may become unobtainable as a result.

If the Dragonborn joined Harkon's court, he will remain in Castle Volkihar as a servant to the Dragonborn. He can be asked two questions; however, he will not offer to purchase the Elder Scrolls from them.

Florentius Baenius is quite outspoken and loud in his interactions with others. Despite being a priest, he frequently makes wild claims about his prowess in combat and generally acts in a non-priestly manner.
Supposedly the Aedra Arkay, god of burials and funeral rites, converses with him regularly. Other Dawnguard members such as Sorine Jurard dismiss this behavior as eccentric. Regardless of Arkay's involvement, Florentius repeatedly obtains highly detailed information that he would have no feasible way of learning otherwise—such as learning when one of the Dragonborn's friends have been kidnapped and having highly detailed information about the inhabitants of the radiant locations he sends the Dragonborn to.

Once at the fort, Florentius can be seen having traded his robes in for a set of Dawnguard Heavy Armor.

When asked about the old Dawnguard, he has quite a negative opinion and remarks that they were not the noble defenders that people make them out to be. He believes they were no strangers to looting and pillaging homes, and were even said to have hidden caches that bore their sigil. Supposedly, these caches can be opened using Sun Fire. Although these ancient caches no longer exist, the modern day Dawnguard employ a similar method of hiding supply caches for members out in the field.

He looks out for the Dragonborn and will often comment that morality is very important, as it is what separates humans from vampires. Like Isran, he is honorable, though less staunch, more relaxed and more open-minded. Upon first meeting him he exclaims, ""By the Eight,"" suggesting he may have abandoned or rejected Talos worship. His family was killed by vampires, much like Isran's, and he chooses to defend others from vampire attacks, rather than seek revenge, always keeping the same message running through his mind: to never let another human being face the same fate he did.
Once a member of the Dawnguard he will move to Fort Dawnguard, trading in his default armor for the Dawnguard Armor. There he will offer a variety of services.

/wiki/Harkon,"Lord Harkon is a Nord vampire, the leader of the Volkihar Clan in The Elder Scrolls V: Dawnguard, and the primary antagonist, regardless of the side taken during Bloodline. A powerful Vampire Lord, Harkon rules his brood with an iron fist. He will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, even if it means the estrangement of his own family. Harkon is one of the few individuals in Tamriel capable of granting pure-blood vampirism.
If asked about how he got his vampirism, Harkon will say how he once ruled as a mighty king, and that his domain was said to be vast and powerful. Despite all of this, his greatest fear was his own mortality, so he pledged himself to Molag Bal and in his name he sacrificed a thousand innocents. In return, the Lord of Enslavement granted him immortality by turning him and his family into pure-blood vampires.
As the years passed and Harkon ran Volkihar, he uncovered a prophecy called the Tyranny of the Sun, that, were it to be enacted, would blot out the sun and allow his kin to roam freely during the day. He started becoming obsessed with the prophecy and everything in his life, including his family, was pushed aside to try and make it a reality. 
To enact the prophecy he required the ancient artifact called Auriel's Bow and the blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour. He would then taint an Elven arrow with the blood and shoot it at the sun with the bow. Harkon wanted to use his daughter, Serana, as a source for the blood, as she is a Daughter of Coldharbour. His estranged wife Valerica saw how obsessed Harkon was becoming and disagreed with his goal. She believed that vampires should stay in the shadows, otherwise it would bring too much attention to their kind, and that mortals would wipe out the vampires, attempting to bring the sun back.
In an attempt to stop him fulfilling the prophecy, Valerica locked Serana along with an Elder Scroll in Dimhollow Crypt for her protection, Valerica herself escaped to the Soul Cairn with the other scroll sometime before the events in Skyrim. Harkon, enraged by this betrayal, commanded every vampire in his court to look for them. After the Dragonborn finds Serana and brings her to Castle Volkihar, Harkon regains the confidence to continue his quest to fulfill the prophecy.
Harkon is an elitist and sees mortals as inferior beings. He has little regard even for his family, and only remembers his wife and daughter due to his lust for power, though he does seem to think that his actions are benefiting vampire kind. Harkon is cruel and will not let anything stop him in his quest for domination. He views the vampires found throughout the rest of Skyrim to be no more than feral animals that ""frighten the herd"" of mortal citizens of Skyrim that he and his fellow ""pure-bloods"" feed upon.
He harbors significant resentment towards his estranged wife, Valerica, and wished to enact revenge upon her for her betrayal. Similarly, Harkon holds a deep abhorrence for lycanthropes, considering the condition ""filthy.""
The Dragonborn first encounters Harkon upon returning Serana to Castle Volkihar after the quest ""Awakening."" As a reward, he offers the Dragonborn the ability to become a Vampire Lord and join his clan of vampires. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can refuse his offer and fight with the Dawnguard against him.
If the Dragonborn sides with the vampires, Harkon sends the Dragonborn and Serana on a quest to find someone capable of reading the Elder Scroll. The two soon learn they need to find Dexion Evicus, a Moth Priest who can read Elder Scrolls, who's held up in Forebears' Holdout. After getting Dexion and bringing him back to the Castle, the Dragonborn learns that two additional Scrolls are needed to complete the prophecy. Harkon then sends the Dragonborn to find them, stating that they are located hidden with his wife Valerica and the other in some Dwarven ruins. After finding and deciphering the last two Elder Scrolls, the Dragonborn is finally sent to recover Auriel's Bow.
Eventually, the Dragonborn and Serana realize that Harkon's plan will doom vampires and mortals alike and decide to stop serving him. Once the three Elder Scrolls of Blood, Dragon, and Sun have been deciphered and Auriel's Bow has been gained in the quest ""Touching the Sky,"" the Dragonborn and Serana go to Castle Volkihar to confront Harkon. After some dialogue, there is the option to either kill Harkon or give him the bow. Either way, Harkon begins the fight.

/wiki/Isran,"Yes, until Destroying the Dawnguard (If the Volkihar Clan is joined)Always (If the Dawnguard is joined)
Isran is the stoic Redguard leader and founder of the modern Dawnguard. He also serves as a master skill trainer in Heavy Armor and will offer his services to the Dragonborn if they join the Dawnguard.
He was previously a member of the Vigilants of Stendarr years ago after witnessing his family's death at the hands of Molag Bal Vampire cultists, alongside Celann. Dissatisfied with the order, and the fact the Vigil found his methods ""extreme,"" they both left to form their own partnership. It didn't last long, as Celann began to disagree with some of Isran's methods. 
In 4E 201, after a recent spate of vampire attacks, Isran went on to revive an ancient order of vampire hunters known as the Dawnguard. He re-established its headquarters in Fort Dawnguard, a massive fortress deep within the Velothi Mountains and rallied new recruits in order to combat the undead menace.
Isran has a strong sense of righteousness and in addition believes it is his duty to protect Skyrim from vampires. However, he tends to prioritize killing vampires over most other things, and would even put the lives of innocents at stake in order to aid his cause. Even though he is not from Skyrim, he is proud to live there as heard through his battle cries. Despite no longer being a Vigilant, he still believes in Stendarr. He has quite a cold demeanor initially, perhaps the only trait he shares with his counterpart, Harkon. His unfriendliness goes to new extremes when Serana is among the Dawnguard; he talks to her in harsh tones and constantly refers to her as 'it', even to her face. However, towards the end of the main questline, Isran refers to Serana by her name, rather than 'it', and goes as far to thank her for helping kill Harkon. According to him, his hatred of vampires is what keeps him strong; that, and constant vigilance. Compared to Gunmar who also lost his family to vampires, his drive to purge the land of vampires is not out of protecting people from the vampire menace but out of pure hate. Despite these negative traits, he is still compassionate and forgiving, as he did not gloat about his dire predictions coming true to Vigilant Tolan.
He is so tense and alert that he belittles the Dragonborn for sleeping, claiming it to be a weakness. The Dawnguard's leader is perfectly content expecting the worst to happen. However, while others mocked him, he read the signs and was able to take the right measures.
Isran apparently has a consistent habit of falling-out with people and holding grudges. The Vigil let him go after he proved too ""extreme."" Celann explains that he was never happy with Isran's rough and violent methods, and broke off their partnership. Florentius, the priest of Arkay, never got on with him either. However, Isran is not so petty as to stay mad at people in times of need. To the surprise of his old colleagues, he recruits them to help the Dawnguard. In his own gruff manner, he continued to care for these people too. Upon hearing of Keeper Carcette and the other Vigilants' deaths, he shows sorrow and compassion for their losses. If anything, it gives him more fuel for his obsession: to exterminate all Vampires.
He makes this more clear if the Dragonborn returns to Fort Dawnguard after either contracting vampirism or becoming a Vampire Lord, angered that the Dragonborn has become one of them and directs them to Morthal to seek a cure from Falion, stating that until the Dragonborn does that, he will not allow them to remain in Fort Dawnguard, saying ""How dare you come back here after being infected by one of them."" and ""Get out of here, monster.""
Isran is a formidable opponent, more than capable of spearheading an assault on vampires. He wields a Dawnguard warhammer with lethal force, especially deadly to Vampires. He uses the Dawnguard-exclusive spell Stendarr's Aura.
After hearing about an order of vampire hunters who are recruiting, the Dragonborn goes to join them at Fort Dawnguard. Isran and Celann meet both the Dragonborn and Agmaer and induct them into the group.
After a plea from Tolan, Isran sends the Dragonborn to investigate what the vampires who attacked the Hall of the Vigilant were looking for within Dimhollow Crypt, which was just up the mountain from the Hall of the Vigilant.
Furious at the Dragonborn's compassion to Serana and delivering an Elder Scroll to the Vampires, Isran orders the Dragonborn to make amends and recruit two of his old colleagues to their cause: Sorine Jurard and Gunmar. When they return to Fort Dawnguard, Isran checks to make sure they haven't contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, then lets them into the fort to begin their work with strengthening the Dawnguard for future battles with the Vampires.
Isran brings the player to reunite with Serana, who has fled from her father, Harkon. While disgusted at her presence, Isran is interested to hear about a Moth Priest in Skyrim and could help them understand the Tyranny of the Sun that Serana mentions. He sends the Dragonborn to retrieve Dexion Evicus to help read Serana's Scroll and see if it provides any details that could aid the Dawnguard against Harkon.
After the Dragonborn retrieves Auriel's Bow, leaving him amazed that they have the object that Lord Harkon seeks to complete the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy, Isran rallies the Dawnguard to prepare for the final assault against Harkon and his court at Castle Volkihar, taking Sorine Jurard, Durak, Florentius Baenius, Gunmar, Celann, and an Armored Troll with him to the castle. Once joined by the Dragonborn and Serana, they attack the castle and eliminate all of Harkon's court members, including his two Death Hounds, Garmr and CuSith, leaving Serana and the Dragonborn to face Harkon alone. After Harkon is slain, Isran thanks Serana for her help, showing newfound respect for Harkon's daughter. He offers the Dragonborn a chance to return to Fort Dawnguard to continue working with the Dawnguard to weed out other vampires around Skyrim, knowing that Auriel's Bow is in good hands.
He and the others members in Fort Dawnguard are targets for this vampire side quest with eliminating them to ensure the Dawnguard won't be a threat to Harkon's court any longer.

/wiki/Knight-Paladin_Gelebor,"Knight-Paladin Gelebor Knight-Paladin Gelebor is one of the last known Snow Elves alongside his brother, Arch-Curate Vyrthur, in The Elder Scrolls V: Dawnguard. He has served as a sentinel and Knight-Paladin at the Chantry of Auri-El for thousands of years.
Gelebor's exact age cannot be determined, but he is believed to have been present before the Atmoran conquest of Skyrim in the First Era, when the Snow Elf civilization was a wealthy and prosperous society.[1]
During this time, he served as a Knight-Paladin for the Chantry of Auri-El, the epicenter of worship in the Snow Elf faith, and a retreat for those who wished to become enlightened. He is responsible for protecting the Chantry, and everything in it, until he dies.[1]
Following the war with the Atmorans, most of his race was either wiped out or forced into hiding.[2] Eventually, many of his kin took refuge with the Dwemer, a subterranean race of mer.[3] The Chantry itself was quite isolated, so much of the worldly affairs occurring in Skyrim passed them by. Only about a hundred or so Snow Elves remained within the Chantry, by the time the Snow Elves of Skyrim and Solstheim were hunted to extinction, but the Chantry managed to remain a secret to both the Dwemer and the Atmorans for many years.[1]
Ironically, their downfall came from Falmer; the twisted race into which their fellow Snow Elves, those who had taken refuge with the Dwemer, had devolved.[3] The Falmer eventually discovered Gelebor and the remaining followers of Auri-El, and swarmed the Chantry in vast numbers until they were completely overrun. Gelebor led a small group of paladins, but they were no match for the Falmers' sheer numbers. The Falmer even found a way to breach the Inner Sanctum, where Gelebor's brother, the Arch-Curate, resided. In the end, Gelebor and his brother were the only two Snow Elves who survived.[1]
In the centuries since the disappearance of his race, Gelebor has stayed true to his oath as a Knight Paladin and continued to tend to the Chantry. He became estranged from his brother Vyrthur, who remained at the Inner Sanctum, and has long believed the Falmer corrupted him when the Chantry was attacked. Gelebor has never been able to confront Vyrthur, however, as he believes leaving the Wayshrines within the Chantry unguarded would be violating his sacred duty.[1] Over the years, countless travellers and adventurers have discovered the Chantry while searching for Auriel's Bow. Gelebor proposed the same arrangement to each of them — the death of his brother in return for the bow. None have ever been successful,[1] until around the time of 4E 201, when Serana and the Last Dragonborn successfully obtained the bow.
Gelebor is encountered in Darkfall Cave at the shrine of Auriel when searching for Auriel's Bow, and will ask the Dragonborn to kill his brother, who he believes has become corrupted by the Falmer.
Upon completion of the quest, he will offer to make Sunhallowed Elven Arrows from normal Elven arrows. Gelebor can create stacks of 20 at a time, or can create them individually or in small groups.

/wiki/Serana,"Serana is an ancient, pure-blood vampire and the daughter of Lord Harkon and Valerica. She is known as one of the ""Daughters of Coldharbour,"" and because of this she is central to the main questline in Dawnguard. After being encountered, she can be recruited as a follower, unlocking a multitude of interactions.
Serana was originally locked away in the mid-late Second Era, in between the rule of the Reman and Septim Empires.[UL 1]
She is one of the few pure-blood Vampires known to exist, and gained her vampirism through a ritual in which members of her family pledged themselves to Molag Bal. Females like Serana and her mother, Valerica, who survive the horrific ordeal are dubbed ""Daughters of Coldharbour.""
Her father, Lord Harkon, is leader of the Volkihar Clan based in Castle Volkihar. He discovered an ancient prophecy called the Tyranny of the Sun which, if enacted, would allow vampires to roam the world freely without the fear of weakness from the sun, but to do so, he required three Elder Scrolls, Auriel's Bow, and Serana for a ritual sacrifice.
In response to this, her mother hid her away with one of the Elder Scrolls in a sealed sarcophagus within Dimhollow Crypt for thousands of years, in order to protect her from her father. She then fled to the Soul Cairn with the other Scroll.
She is enterprising and friendly, but also lonely due to her troubled childhood and her mother's self-exile, which is why she confides in the Dragonborn. She is wary of the Dragonborn at first meeting, refusing to share inventories, answer questions in detail, and not letting them travel too far ahead alone when told to wait. Because of her Vampiric weakness and time spent in Dimhollow, she will also complain to the Dragonborn about caves and the sun, yet also complain when the weather is anything but sunny as the sun is her preference. Although she complains a lot, she also acknowledges the beauty of Skyrim, especially areas featuring groves and rivers, stating that she is happy to be there with the Dragonborn.
She harbors a degree of resentment towards her mother, Valerica, for locking her away for centuries and is angry that her feelings were not taken into consideration.
As a child she was close with her mother, but once her parents began to fight, she felt trapped between both. Her mother would often feed her negative opinions of her father and after a time Serana began to believe them. She was never very close with her father, Harkon, before her family became vampires, but once they became followers of Molag Bal, her relationship with him only worsened as her parents became drunk with power and were always in conflict. Her father started to see her as a means to an end and would often state that ""power takes precedence."" Despite this she still admits to loving him as he is still her father.
She feels trapped between the conflict that consumes her parents and sees herself as a pawn that they are using against each other. Deep down she wishes they were able to reconcile and become a family again, but realizes that it is not possible.
When questioned about her vampirism, she can be defensive. She prefers not to talk about the actual ceremony as it was degrading, but she also does not seem to regret the power it has granted her, and rather sees it as a gift that she earned. The only regret she does seem to have is how it tore her family apart.
After the Hall of the Vigilant was attacked and destroyed by vampires, the Dragonborn is sent to Dimhollow Crypt to investigate further. Serana is discovered in the crypt and set free after the Dragonborn has killed Lokil and all his vampires and thralls that had been in the crypt looking for her. She asks the Dragonborn to help her get home to Castle Volkihar.
Serana indicates her desire to locate her estranged mother, Valerica. She believes that she may have left a clue to her whereabouts somewhere in the courtyard of Castle Volkihar. The Dragonborn must travel with Serana and infiltrate the castle to discover the whereabouts of Valerica.
It is discovered Valerica fled to the Soul Cairn via a portal in Castle Volkihar. The Dragonborn and Serana must travel there to retrieve the Elder Scroll Valerica took with her.
As Dexion Evicus, the Moth Priest who read Serana's Elder Scroll, is now blind, the Dragonborn and Serana must travel to Ancestor Glade and learn how to read the Elder Scroll that will show them where to obtain Auriel's Bow.
Serana travels with the Dragonborn to the Forgotten Vale to seek Auriel's Bow. Upon reaching the Inner Sanctum and meeting Arch-Curate Vyrthur, she discovers her role in the ancient prophecy her father was pursuing, and that Vyrthur was the one who created it out of revenge for being abandoned by Auriel when he was afflicted with vampirism.
Serana travels with the Dragonborn back to Castle Volkihar to confront her father, Lord Harkon.
Serana also displays specific reactions in some locations. When approaching Molag Bal's altar in Markarth's abandoned house, Serana kneels and protects her head with her arms. If taken to High Hrothgar, she will also kneel on the ground, but in a posture of prayer similar to the Greybeards. If she is in the Dawnstar sanctuary, she will also curl up and cover her head with her arms.
Initially, Serana has fewer follower commands than other followers during the Dawnguard questline. Once the questline is completed, she can serve as a regular follower with the same set of commands that other followers have. In some circumstances, however, she may refuse to follow a command, or accept it conditionally. Serana has no ""I need you to do something"" dialogue option, instead, holding down the ""activate"" button, when looking at her, should enter the command mode directly. This should also work from a distance.
She will equip enchanted rings, chains and circlets, as well as both light and heavy armor. When outdoors, however, she wears her hood which displaces any circlets.
Upon completion of Touching the Sky, Serana will offer to make Bloodcursed Elven Arrows for use with Auriel's Bow. Note that if the Dragonborn cured Serana of her vampirism, this ability to make such arrows will be lost. This limits the supply of these arrows to the ones made before she was cured.",Serana,Serana,,Nord,Female,,11124,11116

/wiki/Sorine_Jurard,"Sorine Jurard is a Breton and expert on Dwemer technology. She becomes the weapons specialist in the Dawnguard, mainly in crossbows. She uses her knowledge on Dwemer technology to aid in upgrading the Dawnguard's crossbows and bolts.
She was an old associate of Isran many years ago, but left on bad terms when he made it clear he didn't need her help any longer. After she left, she pursued her interest in Dwemer technology and was last reported to being somewhere in The Reach, attempting to uncover a large Dwemer ruin.
Isran tasks the Dragonborn to recruit Sorine into the Dawnguard. She can be found west of Druadach Redoubt and south of Darkfall Cave, at the unmarked location Dwemer Ruins: Druadach. When first met she complains that she cannot find her satchel of Dwarven gyros and suspects that mudcrabs may have stolen them. She asks the Dragonborn to retrieve either the stolen sack or find a single gyro for her. Upon completion of the quest, she can be found at Fort Dawnguard, having traded her leather armor in for Dawnguard Armor.
Sorine will explain that she has located a schematic that can provide a new upgrade or ammunition type for the crossbow. She asks the Dragonborn to retrieve it from a radiant location, typically a Dwarven Ruin or Bandit stronghold. Once the schematic has been delivered, she will teach the Dragonborn how to craft the item, provided the corresponding Smithing perk has been unlocked. Access to additional weaponry and ammunition will be granted for the Dragonborn, though none of the Dawnguard will be seen taking advantage of this as well.
At Fort Dawnguard, she serves as a general goods merchant, and notably sells around 200 steel bolts at a time. She can also provide training in Archery to the master level. Once her ""Ancient Technology"" quests are completed, she will start selling the new weapons and ammunition in her inventory.
It is possible for the Dragonborn to acquire a large number of steel bolts from her even if they sided with the vampires by using the following exploit. First, the quest ""Destroying the Dawnguard"" must be active. Before going to the fort, however, create a potion of Fortify Illusion. Now go inside the fort, drink the potion, and cast the Master-level spell Harmony. If the potion is powerful enough, the Dawnguard will not fight the Dragonborn and will, moreover, allow them to talk and shop with them. This exploit can be used to buy an Armored Troll, a crossbow, bolts, and Spell Tomes that are otherwise exclusive to the Dawnguard.

If the Dragonborn has no Aetherium items, Taron does not ask about them. However, if dialogue is engaged with him, he may be asked who he is and told that Katria had mentioned him.

He may also appear with his three mercenaries in the Silver-Blood Inn. The same conversation as above is automatically initiated when the inn is entered.

/wiki/Valerica,"Valerica is the estranged wife of Lord Harkon, leader of the Volkihar Clan. They have a daughter named Serana, whom Valerica kept hidden in a tomb for centuries to protect her from her father. Lord Harkon plots to end the Tyranny of the Sun, but to do so he requires Auriel's Bow and Serana's blood for a ritual sacrifice.
She, along with Harkon and Serana, were once devout followers of Molag Bal. Tradition of their cult dictated that the females be offered to Molag Bal on his summoning day. Being selected as an offering was considered to be an honor that was not rejected lightly. Few survived the ordeal, and those who did emerged as pure-blooded vampires. Such confluences were known as the ""Daughters of Coldharbour."" As such, both Valerica and Serana underwent this horrific and degrading ritual.
Sometime before the events of Skyrim, Valerica fled her home of Castle Volkihar with two Elder Scrolls after Harkon became obsessed with the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy. She believed that vampires should stay in the shadows, otherwise it would bring too much attention and ultimately lead to their extinction. She locked Serana and one Elder Scroll in Dimhollow Crypt for her protection and escaped to the Soul Cairn with the other. Outraged by this betrayal, Lord Harkon immediately ordered everyone within his court to find her, but they unfortunately failed, and centuries later, he eventually gave up looking for her. He did, however, say that if she returns on her own, or if someone within his court finds her, she will have to answer for her actions.
When she entered the Soul Cairn, she intended to strike a bargain with the rulers of the realm, the Ideal Masters. She requested refuge, and in return, Valerica would provide them with the souls that they craved. The Ideal Masters had other plans, as they valued Valerica's soul much more. They sent their Keepers to kill her, but she was able to retreat into a fortress and keep them at bay. This, however, turned into a stalemate as neither side had the upper hand. The Ideal Masters constructed a barrier around the fortress that could not be breached in order to contain Valerica and decided to wait. As the passage of time has little meaning in the Soul Cairn, the waiting game continued for thousands of years.
The Dragonborn may travel with Serana to the Soul Cairn to confront Valerica and obtain an Elder Scroll. She explains that the Elder Scrolls are merely a means to an end, and that Serana is the key to the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy. It's revealed that Serana's scroll tells of Auriel's Bow, and the scroll in Valerica's possession declares that ""The Blood of Coldharbor's Daughter will blind the eye of the Dragon.""
She offers her scroll to the Dragonborn if they defeat the three Keepers maintain the barrier. She also warns that a fearsome Dragon named Durnehviir is roaming this plane and is charged with overseeing the Keepers.
Once Durnehviir is slain she will remark about how she thought she would never see the death of that dragon, but realizes that his physical form is just displaced.
Though Serana spent a lot of time with her mother before her exile, Serana comes to realize, in the Soul Cairn, that Valerica is as bad as her husband in the sense that she uses her daughter to further her plans.
After the Dragonborn kills Harkon, it is possible to travel back to the Soul Cairn and tell her Harkon is dead. She will return to her study about a day later. After Valerica returns to the castle, she will plant new herbs in the garden in the courtyard, provided Garan Marethi is asked to repair the corridor that leads there. The Corridor cannot be repaired if the Dragonborn sides with the Dawnguard.
The Dragonborn can ask her to make Bloodcursed Elven Arrows, but she replies that even though Harkon is dead, she wants to stay as far away as possible from completing the prophecy that Harkon envisioned.

He arrived to Solitude and met Sybille Stentor who supported him and directed him to the Rift. After a few months he heard a rumor from a hermit named Jokull who had discovered red water pouring from the ground. Jokull had been digging a basement beneath his house, this basement was actually heading to the Redwater Spring. Jokull woke and burned the house while struggling with Venarus.[2]
He then made some thralls to keep the digging. They were struggling for food sources but he realized that the Redwater Spring actually created disease to mortals with the addition of addiction.[1] On the contrary, vampires gained powers but for a limited time only.[1][2]
He then began to use the waters of the Bloodspring into the process for turning Moon Sugar to Skooma creating Redwater Skooma.[2] He turned the basement into a den and began to lure people back, turning the disappointment of the spring into a ready supply of blood.
He then continued to research for a way to drink from the spring without any side effects, discovering that the Bloodstone Chalice was the key.[2]

Like the rest of the vigilants at Ruunvald, he is under the influence of the warlock Minorne and the Staff of Ruunvald, which forces him to attack the Dragonborn on sight.
Volk was a member of the Vigilants of Stendarr stationed at the Hall of the Vigilant prior to its destruction by the Volkihar Clan. For months while he was at the Hall of the Vigilant, Moric Sidrey, a fellow Vigilant, had been trying to convince the rest of the order to help him excavate the ancient Nordic ruin Ruunvald.
Volk initially dismissed Moric's claims about the ruin, as he had never heard of it and doubted there could be anything of value to be had there. Most of the Vigilants shares Volk's views on the matter, but Moric was able to secure a small team to begin his excavation.
Soon, Moric was sending word back to the Hall of the Vigilant of ancient treasures he was uncovering there, drawing more attention from the order and bring more workers and even a handful of huskies to Ruunvald. Eventually, after Moric had broken into the main chamber, Volk finally relented and joined the expedition. Due to his late-coming, however, he was placed of guard duty outside of the excavation site, along with the priest of Arkay, Florentius Baenius.
After two weeks of completely uneventful lookout duty, Volk began keeping a journal in which he described the events leading up to his guard duty. The only notable thing to happen was when the workers came back up to the surface for supplies. This would become increasingly infrequent, raising Volk's suspicions about the Ruunvald excavation. Two days later, a Vigilant named Apa came up with an emotionless expression to tell Volk and Florentius that they should come down to the site, and Apa was the last Vigilant Volk saw.
After three more days, Volk recorded the final entry in his journal, and he and Florentius went down into the excavation site, where they discovered that the excavation was really being led by the warlock Minorne, who had been using the Staff of Ruunvald to subjugate the wills of the Vigilants there. She then charmed Volk and imprisoned Florentius, who was likely resistant to the staff's effects.
When the Dragonborn arrives at Ruunvald looking for Florentius, Volk is charmed like the rest of the Vigilants and will attack the Dragonborn on sight. While it is possible to sneak or run past him without killing him, Volk will ultimately die when Minorne dies, as will Moric, Apa, and the other twelve charmed vigilants in Ruunvald. Since Minorne must be killed to free Florentius, as the key will not appear until she is dead, it is impossible to spare Volk without modding the game.",Volk,Male Even Toned Accented,MaleEvenTonedAccented,Nord,Male,,81172,103808

/wiki/Adril_Arano,"Adril Arano is the Dunmer second councilor of Raven Rock.
A stern and uncompromising Dunmer, Adril's abrasive personality comes across to the Dragonborn upon first meeting Arano upon arrival at Raven Rock, a reflection of living through harsh times on Solstheim. He is completely committed to his role as Second Councilor to Lleril Morvayn, with whom he shares a lifelong friendship, and as such is completely devoted to the governance of Raven Rock, much to the chagrin of his wife, Cindiri Arano. As the Dragonborn continues to prove their trustworthiness, he eventually comes to respect and trust the Dragonborn enough to confide the potential assassination plot against Lleril Morvayn. Upon completion of Served Cold and foiling the assassination, Arano's demeanor towards the Dragonborn softens considerably, addressing them now with respect, stating that he will never forget that the Dragonborn has succeeded where he has failed. Cindiri notes that the efforts of the Dragonborn on Solstheim have been most invigorating for her husband, and cannot remember seeing him this pleased in many years.
Adril is met upon arriving in Solstheim. He can be questioned to learn more information about Miraak. He, like most residents of Solstheim, will not know who Miraak is, but will claim that the name sounds familiar. 
After March of the Dead, Adril Arano requests that the Dragonborn come to speak with him. Arano thinks someone is trying to kill the councilor of Raven Rock and asks the Dragonborn to search the town for clues of Hlaalu presence.",Adril Arano,Adril,,Dark Elf,Male,,98945,98944

Several years ago she was a very successful ebony miner, so much so that she was said to be wealthier than the Councilor Morvayn himself. However, when the ebony mines closed she knew no other trade and turned to drinking to drown her sorrows. She lost all her money and was reduced to a beggar.
After being freed from her indoctrination, she will return to the Abandoned Building in Raven Rock with Rirns Llervu.
She later explains that Geldis Sadri has banned her from drinking at the The Retching Netch and asks if the Dragonborn can somehow persuade him to let her back in. If she is allowed back she will be very thankful and reward the Dragonborn with a gift she once carried in happier times.
If the ebony mines have been reopened at the conclusion of the quest, she finds a job working there and things will begin looking up for her as she mentions it.
During the search for a new steward, Bralsa may be asked to take the job. She says that she might do it for some skooma, but even if the Dragonborn has skooma in their inventory, they are forced to reply that they have none.

Upon speaking to Bujold, she reveals that her group has been kicked out of Thirsk Mead Hall, located up on the hill near the Beast Stone, by a group of Rieklings led by their chief. When the Last Dragonborn offers to help her group retake the mead hall from the Rieklings, she rallies her fellow Nords to join her and the Dragonborn with taking their mead hall back. Once the Rieklings and their chief have been slain, Bujold asks the Dragonborn to accompany her to Hrothmund's Barrow to witness her being dubbed leader of the mead hall again. However, once there, the voice of Hrothmund speaks to her and refuses to grant her leadership of the mead hall, disappointed in her and her Nords for letting themselves become soft and losing the mead hall to the Rieklings in the first place. Afterwards, Bujold decides to start a new tradition at the mead hall and go against Hrothmund's wishes. The Dragonborn can either agree to keep what happened at the barrow a secret, thus allowing Bujold to remain leader, or refuse, forcing Bujold to have to fight the Dragonborn to keep them from telling the truth to Kuvar and the others, resulting in her death.
If the Last Dragonborn decides to aid the Riekling Chief who is in control of Thirsk Mead Hall, the chief will ask the Dragonborn to join his rieklings with traveling down to Bujold's Retreat and killing Bujold and her Nords to prove themselves kin to the rieklings.

He uses healing spells and will heal himself for a large amount if his health drops too low. He also possesses vigorous healing potions which he will use if he has taken enough damage.
One of the most potentially dangerous advantages the Ebony Warrior has in combat is the risk of damaging oneself upon striking him due to his Heavy Armor perk, Reflect Blows.

When talking about her childhood, Frea says that she was an angry child and that the previous chieftain taught her battle skills so that she could put that fire to good use. She also says that one day her mother went to gather firewood in a blizzard and never returned. During the final quest in the Dragonborn storyline, Frea will admit to the Dragonborn that being the shaman of the Skaal was not the path she chose, and that she was hoping instead to be a hunter or chieftain. However, she knows it is her place and accepts it.

Frea will then accompany the Dragonborn through the temple, helping with the fight against the draugr and cultists. Frea gives advice to the Dragonborn and acts almost like a guide to them.

/wiki/General_Falx_Carius,"General Falx Carius is an Imperial found in Fort Frostmoth, located on the island of Solstheim. He is the antagonist of the quest ""March of the Dead.""
Captain Falx Carius was the Imperial commander of Fort Frostmoth. He was a Knight Protector of the Imperial Legion on Solstheim in 3E 427. During his time as Garrison Commander, Carius came into contact with the Nerevarine. Of no relevance to the choices made by the player in game, Carius found himself abducted by the Daedric Lord Hircine and forced against his will to partake in a series of trials during the events of the Bloodmoon Prophecy, along with others on Solstheim. He was forced to confront the Nerevarine inside the Mortrag Glacier, but it is unknown whether or not he survived this encounter.[1]
His subsequent appearance inside Fort Frostmoth, and his increased rank (from Captain to General), imply that he was spared by the Nerevarine. He was presumably killed in the Eruption of the Red Mountain or its following ash storms. He was resurrected by a powerful necromancer and ultimately killed by the Last Dragonborn during the events of Miraak's Insurrection. He was unaware of his own death and resurrection, thinking no time had passed and little had changed.[source?]
Carius most notably has no pupils in his eyes and a Heart Stone embedded in his chest. He wears a unique, unobtainable armor piece that has a chest design similar to General Tullius' Armor, but with a similar color scheme to the Penitus Oculatus Armor. His armor has a brace which holds his heart stone in place, and he also wears unobtainable gauntlets, boots and a helmet identical in appearance to their Imperial Armor counterparts, but are actually unique and named after him, known as the Falx Gauntlets, Falx Boots, and Falx Helmet.
Carius is found to be responsible for the prevalent Ash Spawn attacks on Raven Rock after the Dragonborn finds a Declaration of War written by Carius on the remains of one. Upon showing him the note, Captain Veleth remarks that General Carius lived long ago and should not still be alive, and tasks the Dragonborn with killing Carius to stop the Ash Spawn threat on the colony. He is found in the ruins of Fort Frostmoth along with an army of Ash Spawn.
He is extremely strong, capable of doing severe damage. He typically outlevels the Dragonborn, meaning he will always have a large amount of health and stamina. He summons Ash Spawn to aid him in battle upon detecting the Dragonborn, and wields the Champion's Cudgel, a unique warhammer that randomly inflicts fire, frost, or shock damage. All three damages can trigger independently of one another, possibly all three at the same time.",General Falx Carius,Male Even Toned,MaleEvenToned,Imperial,Male,,107898,107876

/wiki/Ildari_Sarothril,"Ildari Sarothril is a Dunmer necromancer who once served as an apprentice of Neloth, the Telvanni wizard who lives at Tel Mithryn on the island of Solstheim. She is encountered in Highpoint Tower during the quest Old Friends.
The Telvanni wizard Neloth had been planning for many years to enhance his magical abilities by replacing his own heart with a Heart Stone, similar to how Forsworn Briarhearts replace theirs with Briar Hearts. Ildari, his apprentice, volunteered to be his test subject before he underwent the operation himself, but she was accidentally killed when Neloth performed the operation incorrectly, a death he describes as ""most annoying."" At least, that was what he believed — the Dragonborn found her empty sarcophagus, and this led Neloth to suspect she was kept from dying by the Heart Stone still embedded in her chest. From her journals, it becomes apparent during the quest Old Friends that Ildari survived, and greatly resents Neloth's bungled operation — mentioning that he promised her power and glory but gave her only great pain — and that she plans to get her revenge by necromantically raising an army of Ash Spawn to destroy Tel Mithryn.
After escaping her grave, Ildari traveled to Highpoint Tower and was taken in by a group of miners, who believed she was severely injured and nursed her back to health. Through the Heart Stone, Ildari noticed that she had become stronger, could feel the ""bones in the ash"" calling to her, and had learned how to ""bind the spirits to bone and ash and raise a servant to do [her] bidding"" (according to volume II of her journal). However, she also started to become paranoid from constantly hearing the bones' voices in her head. The voices told her that the miners wanted her Heart Stone for themselves. Raising her Ash Spawn from the ground, she killed the miners' leader and then imprisoned the others as her own test subjects, though it is unknown what experiments she conducted on them. Highpoint Tower thereby became her base of operations where she could plot her revenge upon Neloth undisturbed.
Ildari's journal in Fort Frostmoth (unrelated to the three volumes found in Highpoint Tower) details her successful attempts at re-animating General Falx Carius from the dead, to use him as a puppet in her plan to get revenge on Neloth.
Her former presence in Fort Frostmoth is attested to by a journal of hers found in the fort's underground crypt during the quest ""March of the Dead.""
Tel Mithryn is under attack by an unknown force. Ash Spawn killed Neloth's previous steward Varona Nelas, and part of his tower mysteriously withered.
After Neloth assigns to the Dragonborn the task of finding him a new steward, and after the withered part of Tel Mithryn is repaired, a third attack causes Neloth to reveal to the Dragonborn his suspicion that the attacks are organized - the same suspicion that Captain Veleth has about the attacks on Raven Rock. Neloth gives the Dragonborn the task of discovering the source of the attacks. After a while, it turns out that Ildari is behind the attacks, in search of revenge.
In combat, Ildari will use her Staff of Lightning Bolts, ward and Shock spells. If fought in her final chambers, she will be aided by two soul-gem fueled traps that will shoot lightning towards intruders. These traps can be disabled by removing the soul gem manually or with a projectile.
She can be defeated at any time after she initially appears in the line of sight of the player. With a powerful shot or blow in stealth, she may go down in one hit. However, after her health is depleted, as long as she still possesses her heart stone, she will not die. She will drop to one knee, still alive, and can be further attacked, but not damaged. Once downed, the Dragonborn can interact with her and choose the ""Rip Heart Out"" option to kill her.

Over the course of a few weeks this began to change.

The Dragonborn first encounters Talvas during one such attempt to prove himself, trying to perform Conjure Ash Guardian—a particularly tricky spell that only Neloth had mastered at the time. Talvas fails to do it properly, which results in the ""From the Ashes"" quest.
Talvas attempts to summon an Ash Guardian, but the incantation goes awry and he needs the Dragonborn to put down the rampaging creature. While the Dragonborn is fighting the unsuccessfully summoned Ash Guardian, Talvas runs off to keep Neloth distracted.
Talvas offers master level training in Conjuration. If he is gained as a follower, the money paid for training can be taken back from his inventory. 
Talvas sells a wide variety of spell tomes, including the rare Conjure Ash Guardian spell tome. He also sells miscellaneous soul gems.

As a mercenary for hire, he was hired by a Nord from Skyrim. His employer was what Teldryn called a ""true Nord""; had tattoos on his face, wore animal skins, a real ""traditional type"", had an insatiable bloodlust and was extremely stubborn, one of the toughest employers he has ever had.
When asked why he kept working for him, Teldryn responds with ""Simple... he paid well. Very well"". One day, they cleared out a ruined fort near Whiterun and when they got outside, they saw a bandit galloping away on horseback. Teldryn continues on to say that they tracked and chased the bandit for three days, eventually arriving at what Teldryn called the ""largest bandit encampment I'd ever seen."" He says his Nord boss took one look at Teldryn and had the most menacing grin he had ever seen. Teldryn recalls, ""At that moment, I knew I'd never see him again. No amount of money would be worth that kind of death.""
He left Skyrim and made his way back to his home of Solstheim, where he currently lives in the Retching Netch, in Raven Rock.
Teldryn Sero wears a full set of Chitin armor by default. Unlike most followers, he prefers to keep his chitin helmet equipped, even if a helm with a higher armor rating is given to him. Generally, he will switch to a different helm if it fully covers his face, such as the Nightingale Hood.
If inducted into the Blades, Teldryn will exchange all of his chitin gear (helmet included) – however he will lose all of his unique dialogue options. It is possible to remove his helmet with the Perfect Touch pickpocketing perk. Doing so will allow him to equip other headgear given, including helms and circlets.
Teldryn's class and skill set make him a strong ally. Not only are his One-Handed and Destruction skills high, but he is also a conjurer with the ability to summon a flame atronach.
After summoning an atronach, Teldryn will switch to Destruction magic. He uses spells such as Firebolt at range before closing in with a one-handed weapon. If kept at range, he is capable of dual-casting to improve the damage of his spells. Furthermore, he may also utilize a ward spell if he becomes targeted by more than one enemy. If he loses a significant portion of his health, he may cast Fast Healing to sustain himself.
In close combat, Teldryn will begin using the Flames spell interspersed with power attacks. Like all followers, he will switch to a default Hunting Bow and iron arrows if he runs out of magicka and cannot close to range.",Teldryn Sero,Male Dark Elf Cynical,DLC2MaleDarkElfCynical,Dark Elf,Male,,230757,230752

/wiki/Vahlok_the_Jailor,"Command DaedraConjure Flame AtronachEbonyfleshFireballFlame CloakGreater WardIncinerate Vahlok (Dragon Language:  Vahlok, ""Guardian""), most known as Vahlok the Jailor, is a dragon priest. Along with Ahzidal, Dukaan, Miraak and Zahkriisos, he is one of the five named dragon priests found on Solstheim. His full name translates to ""Guardian"" in the dragon tongue.
According to Skaal folklore, Vahlok served as a dragon priest during the rule of dragons in the Merethic Era.[1]
One of his contemporaries, a priest named Miraak, was seduced with promises of power and forbidden knowledge by the Daedric Prince of Knowledge and Fate, Hermaeus Mora. Miraak began to secretly plot against his dragon overlords, however Vahlok discovered his plans and confronted him. The two fought a lengthy battle that was said to have lasted for days and was so destructive that Solstheim was torn apart from the mainland of Skyrim.[1]
At this point, the series of events that took place is unclear. Skaal legend mentions that Vahlok eventually defeated Miraak, but just as he was about to kill him, Hermaeus Mora saved Miraak by transporting him to the realm of Apocrypha. For his victory, Vahlok gained much glory and his dragon masters appointed him as ruler of the island, but not before he was compelled to swear an oath of vigilance to watch for Miraak's return.[1]
Other accounts report that Miraak was defeated and then banished to Solstheim where he was imprisoned in a tomb built by the ancient Skaal. Vahlok was made his jailer and when he eventually died, he was buried in the same tomb so that he could maintain his vigil beyond death.[2] In any case, Vahlok was instrumental in the downfall of Miraak and put a stop to whatever plans he might have had.
Vahlok's legacy is a sharp contrast to his contemporaries on the mainland. Legend paints him as a paragon of loyalty and nobility in his battle against Miraak and goes as far to say he inspired great courage in both men and dragon.[1][3] His reign was said to be a time of peace and prosperity for the people of Solstheim and, unlike the priests of Skyrim, he was remembered as a wise and just leader by the ancient Skaal.[1]
Vahlok can be encountered at the end of Vahlok's Tomb.

Vendil is the husband of Tilisu and the father of Mirri. As an important and wealthy member of the community of Raven Rock, he has contributed largely to the rebuilding of the settlement in gold, resources and manual labour. He also owns along with this family, Severin Manor, a house located within Raven Rock.
Vendil is later discovered to be a member of the exiled House Hlaalu and a member and/or associate of the Morag Tong, seeking the assassination of Lleril Morvayn, the First Councillor of Raven Rock, who according to him, was responsible for the execution of his ancestor Vilur Ulen, wholly ignoring the latter's own history in Raven Rock. Over the course, his real name is revealed to be Vendil Ulen.
The Dragonborn must stop Vendil Severin, his family and his followers, the Morag Tong, from mounting an assassination attempt on Lleril Morvayn. Once he is slain at the end of the quest, enchanted pieces of Chitin Heavy Armor can be looted off his remains. The cuirass is enchanted with fortify heavy armor, and the gauntlets are enchanted with fortify one-handed.

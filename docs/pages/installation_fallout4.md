# Installation Fallout 4
If you get stuck anywhere in the installation process, please see {doc}`/pages/issues_qna` or reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q4BJAdtGUE).

## Requirements
### Hardware Requirements
#### xVASynth
**CPU**  
xVASynth runs in CPU mode by default, using a single CPU core/thread. Generally, if you can already run Fallout 4, xVASynth should work with most CPU setups. 

<details>
<summary><b>GPU (Optional)</b></summary>  

NVIDIA cards that have CUDA can run xVASynth in GPU mode. Using the same GPU for both xVASynth and Fallout 4 may cause stutter.
</details>

#### Mantella
Mantella needs a certain amount of hardware allocation to run successfully, and if this is being soaked up by other hardware intensive mods there is a chance it will crash.

### Storage Requirements
This mod requires ~16GB of space when xVASynth and all voice models are installed. 


### Compatibility
- [WARS - Weapon Addition and Replacement Suite](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/73478) conflicts with the Mantella Mod esp.
- Mantella requires **Windows 10 / 11** (it is yet unconfirmed whether it works on Windows 7)

### Fallout4
```{admonition} Warning
:class: attention

As Mantella accesses and writes to files within your Fallout 4 folder, it is unlikely to work correctly **if you have Fallout 4 stored in Program Files / (x86)**. Please ensure that you have Fallout 4 stored outside of this folder (eg `C:\Games\Steam`).
```

Steam does not allow to create a new Steam Game Library on the same disk. You can either move the whole Steam client outside [as described on this Steam Support page](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327) or use [LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) to allow multiple Steam Game Libraries on one disk.

### Mantella Files
The Mantella files can be downloaded from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/).

| File | Installation |
|----------|----------|
| Mantella Software | Extract this folder somewhere convenient to you (if you need some inspiration, you can store it in Documents). **Do not store this folder in Program Files / (x86), Desktop, or your Fallout 4 folder**. |
| Mantella Mod | This file can be installed in the same way as other mods with your mod manager. |

## xVASynth
xVASynth is used as the text-to-speech engine by Mantella due to it being free open-source software and already having Fallout 4 voice models trained.
1. Download xVASynth via [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1765720/xVASynth/) (preferred) or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49340). Do not store xVASynth in your Fallout 4 game folder.

2. Download the Fallout 4 voice models. You can either download all models, via the xVASynth UI if you have Nexus Premium, or manually via the Nexus Mods page:  

	<br>
	<details>
	<summary><b>xVASynth Model Installation Options</b></summary>  

   	#### üíé Nexus Premium (Quickest)  
   	If you are subscribed to Nexus Premium, (1.) open the xVASynth UI and select "Get More Voices" from the bottom left corner. (2.) Unselect all games except for Fallout 4, (3.) click "Check now" (you will be prompted to login to Nexus), then (4.) "Download All".
	<img src="../_static/img/Nexus_Premium_Fallout4.jpg" alt="xVASynth Voice Models via Nexus Premium" width="800" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

	```{admonition} Note
	:class: seealso

	You may need to restart the download a few times for all voice models to properly download.  
	```
    
	#### üõ†Ô∏è Manual  
   	If you do not have Nexus Premium, you can also download the voice models directly from Nexus [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49340?tab=files) (under "Optional", not "Old"). Once you have manually downloaded each voice model into a folder, unzip the models manually into the correct xVASynth folder (`xVASynth\resources\app\models\fallout4`). Once the extraction is complete, you can delete the zipped voice model files.  
	The contents of `xVASynth\resources\app\models\fallout4` should look like the below:  
	<img src="../_static/img/xvasynth_models_folder_fallout4.JPG" alt="Fallout 4 XVASynth models folder" width="800" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>

	```{admonition} Note
	:class: seealso

	If downloading all models sounds a bit daunting, you can start with the "Piper", "MaleEvenToned", "MaleBoston", "FemaleBoston" voice models to allow you to talk to most generic human NPCs.
	```
	  
	</details>
	<br>


4. Download the .lip plugin for xVASynth [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55605) and download FaceFXWrapper from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20061) (you do not need to download CK64Fixes). Instructions on how to install these are on the .lip plugin Nexus page. Make sure to place FaceFXWrapper in the plugins folder as stated on the .lip plugin page.  
When installed correctly, it should look like the below:  
<img src="../_static/img/lip_fuz_plugin_folder.png" alt="Lip Plugin Folder" width="800" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>

5. (Optional) Download the xVASynth DeepMoji Plugin [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107142). It boosts the emotionality of xVASynth voice models to make them sound less robotic (only available in English). Note that some Fallout 4 XVASynth voice models are older (<3.0) and for those the output will not be improved by use of the DeepMoji plugin.

6. (Optional) Download the xVASynth Punctuation Pitch Adjuster Plugin [here](https://bunglepaws.neocities.org/downloads/punctuation_pitch_adjuster_for_xvasynth.zip). It will add a high pitch tone at the final syllable for sentences that contain a question mark.

## Required Fallout 4 mods
```{admonition} Warning
:class: attention

Always ensure you are downloading the right version of each mod for your version of Fallout 4. You can check your Fallout 4 version by right-clicking its exe file in your Fallout 4. folder and going to Properties -> Details -> File version. it should be 1.10.163.0 (for Fallout 4 desktop) or 1.2.72.0 (for Fallout 4 VR).
```

<img src="../_static/img/fallout4_file_version.JPG" alt="Fallout 4 Version" width="640" height="auto"/>

Please follow the installation instructions on each of the linked pages:

**Fallout 4 Desktop**
| Mod | Notes |
|----------|----------|
| [F4SE](https://f4se.silverlock.org/) | Mandatory : Make sure to get the non VR version. Once installed, run f4se_loader.exe instead of Fallout4.exe. |
| [SUP F4SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/55419) | Mandatory : Needed to generate the files needed for Mantella to communicate with Fallout 4 |
| [Textinputmenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27347) | Optional : Needed to access text input functions | 

**Fallout 4 VR**
| Mod | Notes |
|----------|----------|
| [F4SE](https://f4se.silverlock.org/) | Mandatory : Make sure to get the VR version. Once installed, run f4se_loader.exe instead of the Fallout4.exe. |
| [SUP F4SEVR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/64420) | Mandatory : Needed to generate the files needed for Mantella to communicate with Fallout 4 |

## Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs power the creation of responses by NPCs. There are a number of different LLMs to choose from, ranging from free local models to large externally hosted models.

```{admonition} Note
:class: seealso

Some smaller models may struggle to handle long term conversations and memory summarizing.
```

If you just want to get started without thinking too much about it / explore alternative options later, follow the OpenAI setup instructions below.

### API Models
<details>
<summary><b>OpenAI (First $5 Free)</b></summary>  

Copy your OpenAI secret API key (see [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) if you need help finding it (you will need to set up an account if you haven't already)) and paste into `MantellaSoftware/GPT_SECRET_KEY.txt`. Do not share this key with anyone. While there is a free trial, you will need to set up your payment details for the API to work.
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><b>OpenRouter (First $1 Free, Free Models Often Available)</b></summary>  

Create an account with OpenRouter. Go to the "Keys" tab and generate a new key, saving its value to `MantellaSoftware/GPT_SECRET_KEY.txt`. Do not share this secret key with anyone. In MantellaSoftware/config.ini, set `model` to a model from the list [here](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models) (eg `undi95/toppy-m-7b`). Set `alternative_openai_api_base` to "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" (without quotes).
</details>
<br>

### Local Models
<details>
<summary><b>text-generation-webui</b></summary>  

1. Install the latest text-generation-webui .zip from [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/releases).  
<img src="../_static/img/ooba_zip.png" alt="text-generation-webui .zip File" width="200" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

2. Place a local model into the `text-generation-webui\models` folder (to get started, you can download `toppy-m-7b.Q4_K_S.gguf` from [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Toppy-M-7B-GGUF/tree/main?not-for-all-audiences=true)).  
<img src="../_static/img/toppy_download.png" alt="Toppy Download Location" width="500" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

3. Paste the text "--extensions openai --auto-launch" (as well as "--cpu" for CPU users) into the installed folder's CMD_FLAGS.txt file.  
<img src="../_static/img/ooba_cmd_flags.png" alt="CMD_Flags.txt" width="400" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

4. Start text-generation-webui and wait for the UI to open in your web browser. Navigate to the "Model" tab, select your model from the drop-down list, and click "Load".  
<img src="../_static/img/ooba_load_model.png" alt="text-generation-webui Load Model" width="400" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

5. In your `MantellaSoftware/config.ini` file, set `alternative_openai_api_base` to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1" (without quotes). Don't worry about the `model` setting in `MantellaSoftware/config.ini`, it will be overriden by the model selected in text-generation-webui. 

```{admonition} Note
:class: seealso

Make sure text-generation-webui is running when Mantella is running! 
```
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><b>koboldcpp</b></summary>  

1. Install koboldcpp's latest release from [here](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases). If you want to run koboldcpp on your CPU or otherwise do not have an NVIDIA GPU, download `koboldcpp_nocuda.exe` under "Assets". If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support, download `koboldcpp.exe` under "Assets".   
<img src="../_static/img/kobold_download.png" alt="Kobold Download Files" width="200" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

2. Download a local model, such as `toppy-m-7b.Q4_K_S.gguf` from [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Toppy-M-7B-GGUF/tree/main?not-for-all-audiences=true).  
<img src="../_static/img/toppy_download.png" alt="Toppy Download Location" width="500" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

3. Run koboldcpp.exe. When presented with the launch window, drag the "Context Size" slider to 4096. Click the "Browse" button next to the "Model" field and select the model you downloaded. Click "Launch" in the bottom right corner.  
<img src="../_static/img/kobold_launch.png" alt="Kobold Launch Window" width="400" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

```{admonition} Optional
:class: hint

Under the "Presets" drop down at the top, choose either Use CLBlast, or Use CuBlas (if using Cuda). You will then see a field for GPU Layers. If you want to use CPU only leave it at 0. If you want to use your GPU, you can experiment with how many "layers" to offload to your GPU based on your system.
```
4. In your `MantellaSoftware/config.ini` file, set `alternative_openai_api_base` to "http://localhost:5001/v1" (without quotes). Don't worry about the `model` setting in `MantellaSoftware/config.ini`, it will be overriden by the model selected in the previous step. 

```{admonition} Note
:class: seealso

Make sure koboldcpp is running when Mantella is running! 
```
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><b>koboldcpp Google Colab Notebook (Free Cloud Service, Potentially Spotty Access / Availablity)</b></summary> 

This option does not require a powerful computer to run a large language model, because it runs in the Google cloud. It is free and easy to use, and can handle most .gguf models that are up to 13B parameters with Q4_K_M quantization all on the free T4 GPU you get with Google Colab. The downside is Google controls dynamically when the GPUs are available and could throttle your access at any time, so it may not always work / be available.

To use this method, go to [this web page](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LostRuins/koboldcpp/blob/concedo/colab.ipynb). Click the play button that appears below the text "Enter your model below and then click this to start Koboldcpp."  Wait until text stops generating (probably will take a minute or two).  You should see a URL link near the end of the text after a statement like "Connect to the link below," with a silly name, in a format like `https://its-taking-time-indeed.trycloudflare.com`. You may want to click on the link just to ensure koboldcpp pops up to ensure it is ready before proceeding. 

Select that link and copy it with CTRL+C.  In your `MantellaSoftware/config.ini` file, set `alternative_openai_api_base` to that URL by pasting it, and then add /v1 at the end. So it will look something like `alternative_openai_api_base = https://its-taking-time-indeed.trycloudflare.com/v1`.  Make sure to keep your browser open to the koboldcpp Colab notebook while using Mantella so it does not turn off. If you want to choose a different model to use with this method, make sure it is a .gguf model and follow the instructions on the Colab to do so.

```{admonition} Note
:class: seealso

Be sure to close your browser tab once you've finished your Mantella session to free up the GPU and help avoid hitting Google's usage limits.
```
</details>
<br>

### Other LLM Services
Mantella has the ability to support other language model services, although these services do need to support outputs in the OpenAI format (like text-generation-webui does via the "--extensions openai" option above).

## Whisper
<details>
<summary><b>Whisper via your CPU is handled automatically. Open this section only if you like tinkering</b></summary>  

guillaumekln's Faster-Whisper version of Whisper is used as Speech-To-Text engine by Mantella. The engine is **already part of the executable** and will download a chosen model automatically when launched. Uses a single CPU core by default when listening to the set default Windows microphone. Alternatively text input can be enabled by setting `microphone_enabled = 0` within MantellaSoftware/config.ini.

It is reasonably fast even in CPU mode with the base model. Optionally, to use GPU/CUDA mode, some extra files are required, see [Faster Whisper documentation](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper#gpu). Note that cuBLAS may already be part of the CUDA Toolkit, so you may only require the `cudnn_###_infer64_8.dll` files to be beside the Mantella executable. Afterwards enable `process_device = cuda` under `[Microphone]` in MantellaSoftware/config.ini.
</details>

## Setup & Configuration
1. Set up the MantellaSoftware/config.ini file with your paths to Fallout (`fallout4_folder` or `fallout4VR_folder`), xVASynth (`xvasynth_folder`), and the Mantella Fallout 4 mod (`fallout4_mod_folder` or `fallout4VR_mod_folder`). Optional : (`xtts_server_folder`). You will need to set the `game =` to `Fallout4` or `Fallout4VR` (be mindful of typing it as per the config.ini options). IMPORTANT : ** You do not need to set the path for every game or mantella_mod, just the ones you plan to use. ** 
	- **fallout4_folder**  
	<details>
	<summary>Mod Organizer 2 Users</summary>  

	By default, this is simply the path to your Fallout 4 folder. If you are using a Wabbajack modlist, you may need to try searching for a folder called overwrite/root or "Stock Game" in your Mod Organizer 2 / Wabbajack installation path and set this as your `fallout4_folder` or `fallout4VR_folder` path. 
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary>Vortex 2 Users</summary>  
 
	This is simply the path to your Fallout 4 folder.
	</details>

	- **mod_folder**  
	<details>
	<summary>Mod Organizer 2 Users</summary>  

	You can find the mod folder by right clicking the mod in the Mod Organizer 2 UI and selecting "Open in Explorer":  
	<img src="../_static/img/find_mod_path_MO2.JPG" alt="Mod Organizer 2 Fallout 4 Mod Folder" width="800" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary>Vortex 2 Users</summary>  
 
	You need to point `mod_folder` to your Fallout 4/Data folder. So essentially, you need to take the Fallout 4 folder set in `fallout4_folder` or `fallout4VR_folder` and add "\Data" to the end of it. For example:  
	
	`mod_folder = C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data`  
	</details>
	<br>
2. Run Mantella.exe in MantellaSoftware. Once it does, it is ready for you to select an NPC in-game via the Mantella gun.  
<img src="../_static/img/mantella_exe.png" alt="MCM General Settings" width="500" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  
```{admonition} Warning
:class: attention

Do not try to run Mantella.exe through Mod Organizer 2 / Vortex as it will not work correctly.
```

3. If you add a new unlisted NPC and for some reason the lip sync isn't happening in game you may need to close and reopen Fallout 4.

```{admonition} Note
:class: seealso

While there have not been issues reported with using Mantella in an existing save so far, please be aware that adding mods mid-game can cause problems.
```

The Mantella gun and settings holotape will be added to your inventory as soon as the exit from Vault 111 is complete. If you install the mod mid-game they should be dropped in your inventory as well (might require a cell change for the trigger to happen). The items can also be crafted at the Chem Station under UTILITY. You can end a conversation by simply saying / typing "goodbye". If the NPC responds with "safe travels" then the conversation has ended correctly via this latter method.  


## Other Tips
### Sound volume
Sound volume can be set by modifying the value for `FO4_NPC_response_volume` in MantellaSoftware/config.ini

### Text Input
Text input can be enabled by either setting `microphone_enabled = 0` in MantellaSoftware/config.ini. You can respond by text by using the 'Y' hotkey. This can be changed in holotape settings by entering the  [DirectX scan code](https://falloutck.uesp.net/wiki/DirectX_Scan_Codes).

### Holotape
Many options can be modified in the holotape [Settings] Mantella Settings, such as NPC actions and radiant conversations.  
<img src="../_static/img/fallout4_holotape_settings.JPG" alt="Fallout 4 Holotape Settings" width="970" height="auto" style="padding: 10px;"/>  

### NPCs not Found
If the NPC is unavailable to Mantella (most likely a modded NPC which you can add yourself via {doc}`/pages/adding_modded_npcs`), the message "Conversation ended." should immediately pop up in the top left corner and the conversation will exit. If the only message you see from the starting the conversation is "Conversation ended", please refer to the "Issues Q&A" section for common solutions to this. 

### Caching
Voicelines are cached in the `MantellaSoftware/data/voicelines/` folder. If this data takes up too much space over time, the contents of voicelines/ can be periodically deleted.

### Issues
If you are experiencing errors, please see {doc}`/pages/issues_qna`. Otherwise, please share the details of the errors and your MantellaSoftware/logging.log file on the Mantella Discord [#issues channel](https://discord.gg/Q4BJAdtGUE).
